# Collision Theory {#lecture5}

## Introduction to Kinetic Theories

Up to this point, we have focused on describing and interpreting empirical data—either deriving rate laws from experimental data or proposing reaction mechanisms and comparing their predictions against observations. While this approach allows us to understand the *shape* of concentration–time profiles, it does not explain *quantitative* differences in reaction rates.

Several important questions remain:
- For two bimolecular reactions, which would we expect to be faster, and by how much?
- Can we predict rate constants $k$ (and how they vary with temperature) without experimental data?

While we have discussed the Arrhenius equation, $k = A_0\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta E/RT}$, this is an approximate empirical relationship that requires experimental data to determine $A_0$ and $\Delta E$. To move beyond empirical descriptions, we need microscopic theories that can make quantitative predictions of reaction rates.

In this course, we will examine two such theories:

1. Collision Theory (this lecture)—focuses on gas-phase bimolecular reactions, treating molecules as hard spheres
2. Transition State Theory (lectures 6–9)—considers formation of activated complexes for all types of reactions

## Fundamentals of Collision Theory {#sec:fundamentals}

Collision theory provides one of the simplest microscopic models of reaction rates, specifically for gas-phase bimolecular reactions of the form:

$$\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}$$

For such reactions, we expect a rate law of the form $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$, but what determines the value of $k$?

### Basic Principles and Assumptions {#sec:principles}

Building on the kinetic theory of gases, collision theory makes two key assumptions:

1. Molecules behave as hard spheres
2. Molecules must collide to react

The overall reaction rate is then:

rate = rate of collisions &times; fraction of &ldquo;successful&rdquo; collisions

### Collision Frequency {#sec:frequency}

Consider two molecules A and B with radii $r_\mathrm{A}$ and $r_\mathrm{B}$ and velocities $v_\mathrm{A}$ and $v_\mathrm{B}$. To analyze their collisions, we can adopt the reference frame of molecule B, where:

- B appears stationary
- A moves with relative velocity $v = v_\mathrm{B} - v_\mathrm{A}$

A collision occurs when the closest distance of approach (the &ldquo;impact parameter&rdquo; $b$) is less than the sum of the molecular radii:

$$b < (r_\mathrm{A} + r_\mathrm{B}) = d$$

As molecule A moves through space, it sweeps out a cylindrical volume:

- Radius = $d = (r_\mathrm{A} + r_\mathrm{B})$
- Length (per unit time) = $v$ (the relative velocity)
- Volume (per unit time) = $vS = v\pi d^2$

The collision frequency per unit volume ($Z'$) is then:

$$Z' = \frac{N_\mathrm{A}N_\mathrm{B}}{V^2}v\pi d^2$$

where $N_\mathrm{A}$ and $N_\mathrm{B}$ are the numbers of molecules of each species in volume $V$.

### Average Relative Velocity

The relative velocity between molecules follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The average relative velocity is:

$$\bar{v} = \left(\frac{8k_\mathrm{B}T}{\pi \mu}\right)^\frac{1}{2}$$

where $\mu$ is the reduced mass:

$$\mu = \frac{m_\mathrm{A}m_\mathrm{B}}{m_\mathrm{A} + m_\mathrm{B}}$$

Substituting this into our expression for collision frequency:

$$Z' = \frac{N_\mathrm{A}N_\mathrm{B}}{V^2}\pi d^2\left(\frac{8k_\mathrm{B}T}{\pi \mu}\right)^\frac{1}{2}$$

## From Collisions to Reaction Rates

### Successful Collisions

Not all collisions lead to reaction. We assume a collision is successful if the relative kinetic energy exceeds a threshold activation energy $E_\mathrm{a}$. For a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy is:

$$P(E \geq E_\mathrm{a}) = \exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{a}}{RT}\right)$$

This gives a total reaction rate:

$$\nu = Z' \times P(E \geq E_\mathrm{a}) = \frac{N_\mathrm{A}N_\mathrm{B}}{V^2}\pi d^2\left(\frac{8k_\mathrm{B}T}{\pi \mu}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{a}}{RT}\right)$$

This can be written in the familiar form of a second-order rate law:

\begin{equation}
\nu=k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
k = \pi d^2\left(\frac{8k_\mathrm{B}T}{\pi \mu}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{a}}{RT}\right)
\end{equation}

### Steric Factors {#sec:steric-factors}

When we compare the reaction rates predicted by collision theory with experimental measurements, we typically find that collision theory overestimates reaction rates, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This discrepancy arises because our model of molecules as hard spheres is an oversimplification—successful reactions often require specific molecular orientations or more complex interactions than simple collisions.
To account for these effects, we introduce an empirical correction factor $P$, called the steric factor, that modifies our expression for the rate constant:
\begin{equation}
k = P\pi d^2\left(\frac{8k_\mathrm{B}T}{\pi\mu}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{a}}{RT}\right)
(#eq:steric-k)
\end{equation}
The steric factor $P$ is defined as the ratio of the experimental pre-exponential factor to the theoretical value predicted by collision theory:
\begin{equation}
P = \frac{A_\mathrm{exp}}{A_\mathrm{th}}
(#eq:steric-factor)
\end{equation}
Different types of reactions exhibit characteristic ranges of steric factors. Consider these examples:

1. For the hydrogenation of ethene: H~2~+C~2~H~4~$\longrightarrow$C~2~H~6~
$P = 1.7 \times 10^{-6}$.
This very small steric factor reflects the strict geometric requirements for reaction&mdash;the H~2~ molecule must approach the C=C double bond in a specific orientation for reaction to occur.
2. For the reaction between potassium and bromine:
K+Br~2~$\longrightarrow$KBr+Br
$P = 4.8$.
Here the steric factor is greater than unity, indicating that reactions occur more frequently than predicted by simple collision theory. This enhanced reactivity arises from the "harpoon mechanism", where electron transfer between K and Br~2~ creates long-range attractive forces that effectively increase the collision cross-section.

## Relationship to the Arrhenius Equation {#sec:arrhenius-comparison}

The rate constant derived from collision theory has a remarkably similar form to the empirical Arrhenius equation.
Let us compare them directly:

From collision theory:
\begin{equation}
k = P\pi d^2\left(\frac{8k_\mathrm{B}T}{\pi\mu}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{a}}{RT}\right)
(#eq:collision-k)
\end{equation}

The Arrhenius equation:
\begin{equation}
k = A_0\exp\left(-\frac{E_\mathrm{a}}{RT}\right)
(#eq:arrhenius)
\end{equation}

This comparison provides physical insight into the meaning of the Arrhenius parameters:

1. The activation energy $E_\mathrm{a}$ in the Arrhenius equation can be interpreted as the minimum relative kinetic energy that colliding molecules must possess for reaction to occur. This threshold energy is needed to overcome the potential energy barrier to reaction.
2. The pre-exponential factor $A_0$ represents a normalized collision frequency. The collision theory expression shows that this frequency depends on:
  - The collision cross-section ($\pi d^2$)
  - The average relative velocity of molecules ($\propto \sqrt{T/\mu}$)
  - A steric factor $P$ that accounts for orientation requirements

Therefore, while the Arrhenius equation was originally proposed as an empirical relationship, collision theory provides a theoretical foundation for its functional form and offers molecular-level interpretations of its parameters. However, we should note that this interpretation is strictly valid only for gas-phase bimolecular reactions. For more complex reactions, particularly in solution, the physical meaning of the Arrhenius parameters becomes less clear, and we need more sophisticated theories to understand their molecular basis.

## Limitations of Collision Theory as a Predictive Framework {#sec:collision-limitations}

Collision theory works reasonably well for simple molecules but typically overestimates reaction rates for complex molecules.

Two key limitations prevent collision theory from serving as a fully predictive framework:

- The activation energy E$\mathrm{a}$ appears as an arbitrary &ldquo;threshold energy&rdquo; that molecules must possess to react. While we can measure this energy experimentally, the theory provides no insight into how $E_\mathrm{a}$ varies between different reactions. 
- While we can determine the steric factor $P$ by comparing experimental and theoretical rate constants, we have no quantitative theory to predict its value. This means we cannot predict absolute rate constants for new reactions without experimental data.
