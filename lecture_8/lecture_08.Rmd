# Estimating Pre-exponential Factors {#lecture8}

## From Molecular Freedom to Reaction Rates

In Lecture \@ref(lecture7), we examined how molecular degrees of freedom change when forming the activated complex, and how these changes determine the entropy of activation, $\Delta S^\ddagger$. We saw that forming the activated complex typically transforms high-entropy translational and rotational degrees of freedom into more constrained rotational and vibrational modes. Let us now develop this molecular-level picture into a quantitative framework for predicting reaction rates.

## The Reaction Coordinate

To understand how molecular motion leads to reaction, we must look more carefully at what the reaction coordinate means. Consider a simple atom-transfer reaction A–B + C → A + B–C. We can describe the relative positions of these three atoms using two coordinates: the A–B distance ($r_\mathrm{AB}$) and the B–C distance ($r_\mathrm{BC}$).

At the start of the reaction:

- $r_\mathrm{AB}$ is small (strong A–B bond)
- $r_\mathrm{BC}$ is large (C far from AB)

At the end of the reaction:

- $r_\mathrm{AB}$ is large (A separated from BC)
- $r_\mathrm{BC}$ is small (strong B–C bond)

The reaction coordinate traces the lowest-energy path between reactants and products on this two-dimensional potential energy surface. This path must cross a "dividing surface" that separates reactant-like and product-like geometries. The transition state corresponds to the lowest-energy point on this dividing surface, where typically $r_\mathrm{AB}$ ≈ $r_\mathrm{BC}$.

## The Rate of Barrier Crossing

To describe how fast activated complexes convert to products ($k^\ddagger$), we need to think carefully about what happens at the transition state. Consider our simple atom-transfer reaction A–B + C → A + B–C. At the transition state, we have an activated complex [A$\cdots$B$\cdots$C]$^\ddagger$.

What happens if we move a small distance along the reaction coordinate? If we move towards reactants, $r_\mathrm{AB}$ gets smaller and $r_\mathrm{BC}$ gets larger. If we move towards products, $r_\mathrm{AB}$ gets larger and $r_\mathrm{BC}$ gets smaller. This motion through the transition state looks like an asymmetric stretch of our activated complex. By modeling this as a loose molecular vibration, we can derive the expression:

$$k^\ddagger = \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{h}$$

where $k_\mathrm{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $T$ is temperature.^[The derivation of this expression for $k^\ddagger$ requires a statistical mechanical treatment of transition state theory. You will cover statistical mechanics in the third year of your course.] Because this expression accounts for motion along the reaction coordinate, we must take care when counting vibrational modes in the activated complex: we count only $3N-7$ vibrational modes for a non-linear activated complex (one fewer than the usual $3N-6$), as the reaction coordinate "vibration" is already included in the $k^\ddagger$ term.

## Mathematical Development

The complete transition state theory rate equation can be written as:

$$\nu = k^{\ddagger}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R}\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger}/RT}[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$$

Comparison with the Arrhenius equation:

$$\nu = A\mathrm{e}^{-E_\mathrm{a}/RT}[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$$

reveals that the pre-exponential factor corresponds to:

$$A \approx k^{\ddagger}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R}$$

By separating the entropy of activation into contributions from different types of molecular motion, we arrive at the complete transition state theory expression:

$$A = \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{h}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}_\mathrm{trans}/R}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}_\mathrm{rot}/R}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger,(n-1)}_\mathrm{vib}/R}$$

where the superscript $(n-1)$ on the vibrational entropy term indicates that we consider one fewer vibrational mode than might be expected, since motion along the reaction coordinate is already accounted for in the frequency prefactor $\frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{h}$. This expression is particularly powerful because it allows us to make quantitative predictions of the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor if we can evaluate (or estimate) the changes in translational, rotational, and vibrational entropy when forming the activated complex. For gas-phase reactions, these contributions can be estimated using characteristic values:

- Translational motion: $S^{\ddagger}_\mathrm{trans} \approx 195~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$
- Rotational modes: $S^{\ddagger}_\mathrm{rot} \approx 20~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$
- Vibrational modes: $S^{\ddagger}_\mathrm{vib} \approx 5~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$

## Analysis of Molecular Systems

### Atomic Reactions

The simplest case to analyse is a reaction between two atoms, A + B. Initially, the system possesses:

- Three translational degrees of freedom for atom A
- Three translational degrees of freedom for atom B
- No rotational or vibrational modes

When these atoms combine to form the activated complex [A⋯B]$^\ddagger$, this transforms into:

- Three translational degrees of freedom (describing motion of the complex as a whole)
- Two rotational degrees of freedom (the complex can rotate about two axes)
- One vibrational degree of freedom (corresponding to motion through the transition state)

From these changes in molecular freedom, we can calculate the entropy changes systematically. For translational motion, we lose three degrees of freedom when forming the complex, giving:

$$\Delta S^\ddagger_\mathrm{trans} = -3 \times 195 = -585~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$

The activated complex gains two rotational degrees of freedom:

$$\Delta S^\ddagger_\mathrm{rot} = +2 \times 20 = +40~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$

The vibration through the transition state is already accounted for in our $k^\ddagger$ term, so:

$$\Delta S^\ddagger_\mathrm{vib} = 0 \times 5 = 0~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$

With these entropy changes calculated, we can now determine the pre-exponential factor:

$$A = 10^{13} \times \mathrm{e}^{-3 \times 195/8.314} \times \mathrm{e}^{2 \times 20/8.314} \times \mathrm{e}^{0 \times 5/8.314} \times (N_\mathrm{A} \times 10^3)~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$$

$$= 2 \times 10^{11}~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$$

The factor of $N_\mathrm{A}$ (Avogadro's number) converts from a per-molecule basis to a per-mole basis, since our rate constant needs to work with concentrations in mol dm$^{-3}$. The factor of $10^3$ converts volumes from m$^3$ to dm$^3$, ensuring our final rate constant has the correct units of dm$^3$ mol$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$.

### Polyatomic Systems

For a reaction between a diatomic molecule and a four-atom molecule, we must account for additional molecular freedom in both reactants and the activated complex. Let us examine the initial degrees of freedom systematically.

For the diatomic molecule ($N = 2$), being linear, we have:

- Three translational modes (motion through space)
- Two rotational modes (rotation about axes perpendicular to the bond)
- One vibrational mode ($3N - 5 = 1$ for a linear molecule)

The four-atom molecule ($N = 4$), being non-linear, possesses:

- Three translational modes
- Three rotational modes
- Six vibrational modes ($3N - 6 = 6$ for a non-linear molecule)

When these molecules combine, they form a six-atom activated complex ($N = 6$) with:

- Three translational modes
- Three rotational modes (non-linear complex)
- Eleven vibrational modes ($3N - 7$ for a non-linear activated complex, as one vibrational mode corresponds to motion along the reaction coordinate)

From these molecular properties, we can determine the entropy changes systematically.

For translational motion:

- Initially: six independent translational modes (three per molecule)
- Finally: three translational modes in the complex
- Net loss: three translational degrees of freedom
$$\Delta S^\ddagger_\mathrm{trans} = -3 \times 195 = -585~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$

For rotational motion:

- Initially: five rotational modes (two from diatomic + three from four-atom molecule)
- Finally: three rotational modes in the complex
- Net loss: two rotational degrees of freedom
$$\Delta S^\ddagger_\mathrm{rot} = -2 \times 20 = -40~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$

For vibrational motion:

- Initially: seven vibrational modes (one from diatomic + six from four-atom molecule)
- Finally: eleven vibrational modes in the complex
- Net gain: four vibrational modes
$$\Delta S^\ddagger_\mathrm{vib} = +4 \times 5 = +20~\mathrm{J}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}~\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$

With these entropy changes determined, we can calculate the pre-exponential factor:

$$A = 10^{13} \times \mathrm{e}^{-3 \times 195/8.314} \times \mathrm{e}^{-2 \times 20/8.314} \times \mathrm{e}^{4 \times 5/8.314} \times (N_\mathrm{A} \times 10^3)~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$$

$$= 1 \times 10^8~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$$

As in our atomic example, the factor of $N_\mathrm{A}$ converts to a per-mole basis, while the factor of $10^3$ handles the conversion from m$^3$ to dm$^3$ units.

This more complex example reveals a key feature of molecular reactions: as molecular complexity increases, we typically observe larger decreases in molecular freedom when forming the activated complex. This systematically leads to more negative values of $\Delta S^\ddagger$ and correspondingly smaller pre-exponential factors.

## Limitations in Pre-exponential Factor Estimation

While our molecular freedom approach successfully predicts systematic trends in reaction rates, several important approximations underpin these calculations. Understanding these limitations helps us recognise both the power and constraints of our theoretical framework.

### Statistical Entropy Approximations

Our calculations employ characteristic entropy values for different types of molecular motion:

- Translational motion: 195 J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$
- Rotational modes: 20 J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$
- Vibrational modes: 5 J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$

These values represent statistical averages derived from typical molecular behaviour. For more precise predictions, we require detailed quantum mechanical calculations of molecular energy levels, which can determine specific values for $S^\ddagger_\mathrm{dof}$ based on the actual energy spacing between quantum states. While such calculations provide greater accuracy, our simpler approach using characteristic values remains valuable for understanding trends in reactivity.

### Effects of Molecular Symmetry

Molecular symmetry introduces additional complexity beyond simple counting of degrees of freedom. Consider these parallel reactions:

$$\mathrm{CH}_4 + \mathrm{Br}^\bullet \longrightarrow \mathrm{HBr} + \mathrm{CH}_3^\bullet$$
$$\mathrm{CD}_3\mathrm{H} + \mathrm{Br}^\bullet \longrightarrow \mathrm{HBr} + \mathrm{CD}_3^\bullet$$

Our previous analysis, based purely on counting molecular degrees of freedom, predicts identical pre-exponential factors for both reactions. However, experimental measurements reveal that the CH~4~ reaction proceeds approximately four times faster than the CD~3~H reaction.

This difference arises from molecular symmetry. In CH~4~, all four hydrogen atoms are equivalent—the bromine radical can abstract any hydrogen to form the same product. In CD~3~H, only one hydrogen is available for abstraction. We account for this effect by introducing a statistical factor, $l$, into our transition state theory expression:

$$A = l\frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{h}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^\ddagger/RT}$$

Here $l$ represents the number of different chemically plausible products that can be formed when identical atoms in the reactant molecules are labeled. For our example reactions:

- CH~4~ reaction: $l = 4$ (four equivalent hydrogens)
- CD~3~H reaction: $l = 1$ (single abstractable hydrogen)

### Internal Molecular Motion

The treatment of internal molecular motions reveals additional subtlety in our theoretical framework. Consider the ethane molecule (C~2~H~6~), which exhibits two distinct types of motion around its C–C bond:

1. C–C stretching vibration:
   - Involves direct compression and extension of the C–C bond
   - Requires significant energy
   - Shows widely spaced quantum energy levels
   - Makes small contributions to vibrational entropy

2. C–C torsional motion:
   - Involves rotation of CH~3~ groups about the C–C axis
   - Requires much less energy
   - Shows more closely spaced energy levels
   - Makes larger contributions to entropy

When such molecules form activated complexes, two scenarios commonly arise:

1. Restricted internal rotation:
   - Occurs when specific molecular alignments are required
   - Reduces freedom of internal motion
   - Produces more negative $\Delta S^\ddagger$ values
   - Leads to lower pre-exponential factors than predicted by simple counting

2. Enhanced internal rotation:
   - Occurs when bond lengthening makes rotation easier
   - Increases freedom of internal motion
   - Produces less negative $\Delta S^\ddagger$ values
   - Leads to higher pre-exponential factors than predicted

## Applications and Predictive Power

Despite these limitations, our molecular freedom approach successfully explains systematic trends in experimental pre-exponential factors. Consider these representative reactions:

$$\mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{H}_2 \longrightarrow \mathrm{HBr} + \mathrm{H}^\bullet \qquad A = 3 \times 10^{10}~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$$
$$\mathrm{CD}_3^\bullet + \mathrm{H}_2 \longrightarrow \mathrm{CD}_3\mathrm{H} + \mathrm{H}^\bullet \qquad A = 3 \times 10^8~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$$
$$\text{Diels-Alder cycloaddition} \qquad A = 1 \times 10^7~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$$

The systematic decrease in pre-exponential factors reflects three key features:

1. Increasing molecular complexity in the reactants
2. Greater loss of molecular freedom in forming the activated complex
3. Increasingly negative values of $\Delta S^\ddagger_\mathrm{rot+vib}$: +15, -20, and -35 J K$^{-1}$ mol$^{-1}$ respectively

Our estimation method correctly predicts both the magnitude and ordering of these pre-exponential factors, giving values of $4 \times 10^9$, $1 \times 10^8$, and $2 \times 10^7~\mathrm{dm^3~mol^{-1}~s^{-1}}$ respectively.

The Diels-Alder cycloaddition provides particularly valuable insight into the limitations of our simple counting approach. Our predictions typically overestimate the experimental pre-exponential factors for these reactions because the transition state requires precise alignment of the diene and dienophile components. This geometric constraint introduces additional restrictions on molecular motion beyond those captured by simple counting of degrees of freedom, leading to more negative $\Delta S^\ddagger$ values than predicted.
