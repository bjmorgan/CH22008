# The Mathematical Origin of the Boltzmann Distribution

## Introduction

The Boltzmann distribution is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics, describing how molecules distribute themselves among available energy states at thermal equilibrium. While we often simply quote the result that the probability of finding a molecule in a state with energy $\epsilon$ is proportional to $e^{-\epsilon/k_\mathrm{B}T}$, understanding where this expression comes from provides deep insight into the connection between microscopic molecular behaviour and macroscopic thermodynamic properties.

## Setting Up the Problem

Consider a large collection of $N$ molecules that can exchange energy with a heat reservoir at temperature $T$. Each molecule can occupy different energy states, where:

- $\epsilon_i$ is the energy of state $i$
- $n_i$ is the number of molecules in state $i$

Two fundamental constraints govern how these molecules can be distributed among the available states:

1. Conservation of molecules (constant $N$):
   \begin{equation}
   N = \sum_i n_i
   (\#eq:number-conservation)
   \end{equation}

2. Conservation of energy (constant $E$):
   \begin{equation}
   E = \sum_i n_i\epsilon_i
   (\#eq:energy-conservation)
   \end{equation}

## The Most Probable Distribution

Many different arrangements of molecules could satisfy these constraints. However, some arrangements are more likely than others. To find the most probable distribution, we need to:

1. Calculate how many different ways each distribution can be achieved
2. Find the distribution that maximises this number while satisfying our constraints

### Counting Molecular Arrangements

For a given set of occupation numbers ${n_i}$, the number of distinct ways to arrange $N$ molecules among the available states is:

\begin{equation}
W = \frac{N!}{\prod_i n_i!}
(\#eq:arrangements)
\end{equation}

This is analogous to the number of ways of dealing cards into piles, where $n_i$ represents the number of cards in pile $i$.

### Mathematical Treatment

Working with $W$ directly is challenging because factorials of large numbers are involved. Taking the natural logarithm simplifies our mathematics while preserving the maximum (since $\ln$ is a monotonic function):

\begin{equation}
\ln W = \ln N! - \sum_i \ln n_i!
(\#eq:log-arrangements)
\end{equation}

For large numbers, we can use Stirling's approximation: $\ln n! \approx n\ln n - n$. This gives:

\begin{equation}
\ln W = N\ln N - N - \sum_i (n_i\ln n_i - n_i)
(\#eq:stirling-applied)
\end{equation}

## Finding the Maximum

To find the most probable distribution, we need to maximize $\ln W$ subject to our constraints on total number (Eqn. \@ref(eq:number-conservation)) and energy (Eqn. \@ref(eq:energy-conservation)). This is a constrained optimization problem perfectly suited for the method of Lagrange multipliers.

We introduce two Lagrange multipliers, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and set up the variation:

\begin{equation}
\delta\left[\ln W - \alpha\left(\sum_i n_i - N\right) - \beta\left(\sum_i n_i\epsilon_i - E\right)\right] = 0
(\#eq:lagrange)
\end{equation}

Taking the variation with respect to each $n_i$ gives:

\begin{equation}
-\ln n_i - 1 - \alpha - \beta\epsilon_i = 0
(\#eq:variation)
\end{equation}

Solving for $n_i$:

\begin{equation}
n_i = e^{-1-\alpha}e^{-\beta\epsilon_i}
(\#eq:solution)
\end{equation}

## The Boltzmann Distribution

Dividing by $N$ gives the probability of finding a molecule in state $i$:

\begin{equation}
P_i = \frac{n_i}{N} = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\beta\epsilon_i}
(\#eq:boltzmann)
\end{equation}

where $Z = Ne^{1+\alpha}$ is called the partition function and ensures that probabilities sum to 1.

## Physical Interpretation

The Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ acquires physical meaning by considering energy exchange with the heat reservoir. Detailed analysis shows that $\beta = 1/k_\mathrm{B}T$, where $k_\mathrm{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ is the temperature

This gives us the familiar form of the Boltzmann distribution:

\begin{equation}
P_i = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-\epsilon_i/k_\mathrm{B}T}
(\#eq:boltzmann-final)
\end{equation}

This remarkable result shows that the probability of finding a molecule in a particular energy state depends only on:

1. The energy of that state
2. The temperature of the system
3. A normalisation factor (the partition function)

The exponential form emerges naturally from maximising the number of possible molecular arrangements while maintaining constant energyâ€”we didn't need to assume it. This mathematical derivation reveals the deep connection between molecular-level disorder and macroscopic thermodynamic properties.
