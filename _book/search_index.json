Chemical kinetics addresses the fundamental question of how chemical reactions proceed through time. While thermodynamics tells us about the driving forces and ultimate endpoints of reactions, kinetics reveals the pathways and speeds by which these endpoints are reached. Understanding chemical kinetics helps us to answer practical questions. For a given reaction, A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B, we might want to predict how much product B will be present after a given time, or how long it will take to achieve a desired conversion percentage from A to B. Figure 1.1: A plot of concentrations of reactant A and product B for a generic reaction A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B as a function of time. Over time, A is converted to B. How long will it take to obtain 90% yield? Going beyond this, can we optimise our reaction by changing the conditions (e.g., pressure or temperature)? How would these changes affect the overall rate of our reaction or the reaction yield? Figure 1.2: If we increase the temperature we (usually) expect our reaction to speed up. But by how much? If we increase the reaction temperature by 10 K, how much faster can we reach 90% yield? 1.2 Reaction Rates A core concept in chemical kinetics is the idea of a reaction rate — the speed at which chemical change happens. We express reaction rates mathematically as derivatives of the form \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\), representing the change in concentration of a species X with time. This rate can be positive (for products being formed) or negative (for reactants being consumed). For any reaction that does not have a 1:1 stoichiometry ratio between all reactants and products, the numerical “rate” will depend on the the chemical species we choose to define this. For example, for the reaction \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{B} \\end{equation}\\] the product, B, is formed at twice the rate that the reactant, A, is consumed. Hence, \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] In general, we can define an “overall” reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) that is related to the rates of change of reactants and products by \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n_\\mathrm{X}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n_\\mathrm{X}\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species \\(X\\) in the reaction equation. 1.3 Simple Rate Equations For many reactions, the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants, raised to some power; i.e., \\[\\nu = k [\\mathrm{A}]^a [\\mathrm{B}]^b [\\mathrm{C}]^c \\ldots\\] The proportionality constant, \\(k\\), is called the rate constant. The exponents, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) …, describe the order of the reaction with respect to the reactants A, B, C …. So, for a reaction \\[A + B \\longrightarrow C\\] with rate equation (or “rate law”) \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2[\\mathrm{B}]\\], we would describe this as being second-order with respect to A, and first-order with respect to B. For rate equations that have the simple form above, we can define an overall order, which is the sum of the individual orders with respect to each of the reactants. In the example above, this reaction would be described as being third-order overall, since \\(a+b = 3\\). Not all reactions follow simple rate laws. For example, the reaction between H2 and Br2 to form HBr has an empirically-determined rate law \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^\\frac{1}{2}}{1+k^\\prime [\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br}_2]} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] This rate law is first-order with respect to H2, because \\(\\nu \\propto [\\mathrm{H_2}]\\). But we cannot define an order with respect to Br2, because the overall rate is not simply proportional to \\([\\mathrm{Br}_2]\\) raised to some power. Instead, we would describe the order with respect to Br2 as being undefined. This means the overall order is also undefined, since we cannot siply add the orders with respect to H2 and Br2. 1.4 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of one of more single-step “elementary” processes. For example, for the reaction \\(\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr}\\), where the empirical rate law is given by (1.1), one sequence of elementary processes that is consistent with this rate law is \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{H}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br} &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\end{eqnarray}\\] 1.4.1 Molecularity foo "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
