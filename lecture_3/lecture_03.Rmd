# Parallel Reversibile Reactions {#lecture3}

## Introduction to Parallel Reversible Reactions

Building on our previous discussion of parallel reactions, we now consider systems where the individual reactions are reversible:

$$\mathrm{A} \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftarrows}^{k_1}_{k_{-1}}} \mathrm{B}$$
$$\mathrm{A} \mathrel{\mathop{\rightleftarrows}^{k_2}_{k_{-2}}} \mathrm{C}$$

For such systems, the rate equations are:

$$\frac{d[\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = -(k_1 + k_2)[\mathrm{A}] + k_{-1}[\mathrm{B}] + k_{-2}[\mathrm{C}]$$

$$\frac{d[\mathrm{B}]}{dt} = +k_1[\mathrm{A}] - k_{-1}[\mathrm{B}]$$

$$\frac{d[\mathrm{C}]}{dt} = +k_2[\mathrm{A}] - k_{-2}[\mathrm{C}]$$

## Time Evolution of Product Distributions

### Short-Time Behaviour

At very short times, when [B] ≈ 0 and [C] ≈ 0, the backward reactions can be neglected and the system behaves similarly to the irreversible case we studied previously. The relative yields of products are determined by the ratio of the forward rate constants:

$$\frac{[\mathrm{B}]}{[\mathrm{C}]} \approx \frac{k_1}{k_2}$$

This is often called &ldquo;kinetic control&rdquo;, as the product distribution is determined by the relative rates of the forward reactions.

### Long-Time Behaviour

At long times, the system reaches equilibrium, where:

$$\frac{d[\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = \frac{d[\mathrm{B}]}{dt} = \frac{d[\mathrm{C}]}{dt} = 0$$

At equilibrium:

$$k_1[\mathrm{A}]_\mathrm{eq} = k_{-1}[\mathrm{B}]_\mathrm{eq}$$
$$k_2[\mathrm{A}]_\mathrm{eq} = k_{-2}[\mathrm{C}]_\mathrm{eq}$$

This gives equilibrium constants:

$$K_\mathrm{AB} = \frac{[\mathrm{B}]_\mathrm{eq}}{[\mathrm{A}]_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}$$
$$K_\mathrm{AC} = \frac{[\mathrm{C}]_\mathrm{eq}}{[\mathrm{A}]_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{k_2}{k_{-2}}$$

The final product ratio at equilibrium is:

$$\frac{[\mathrm{B}]_\mathrm{eq}}{[\mathrm{C}]_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{k_1k_{-2}}{k_{-1}k_2}$$

This is called &ldquo;thermodynamic control&rdquo;, as the product distribution is determined by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the products.

## Kinetic vs Thermodynamic Control

The evolution from kinetic to thermodynamic control can be understood by considering how the energy of a molecular system changes as reactants transform to products.

Figure \@ref(fig:fig-reaction-coordinate-diagram) shows an example of a reaction coordinate diagram. 
A reaction coordinate diagram is a schematic representation of how the free energy of a molecular system changes as a reaction proceeds. The horizontal axis is called the reaction coordinate, and represents the progression of the reaction along a particular reaction pathway&mdash;often this corresponds to a specific change in geometry as atoms rearrange and bonds break and form. The vertical axis shows the Gibbs free energy of the system. 

Two key features of these diagrams help us understand reaction behaviour:

- The activation energy ($\Delta G_\mathrm{a}$) represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for reaction to occur. This determines reaction rate—lower barriers mean faster reactions.
- The reaction free energy ($\Delta G_\mathrm{r}$) represents the overall thermodynamic driving force. This determines the position of equilibrium—more negative values mean the products are more favoured at equilibrium.

For our parallel reactions, the diagram shows two paths starting from reactant A: one leading to product B and another to product C. Consider a system where:

- Product B has the lower activation energy (faster formation, kinetic product)
- Product C has the lower free energy (more stable, thermodynamic product)

At short times, B forms more rapidly due to its lower activation barrier. However, if the reaction is reversible (small enough barriers for reverse reactions), the system will eventually equilibrate to favour the more thermodynamically stable product C.

Important factors that determine whether kinetic or thermodynamic control dominates:

1. Reaction conditions:
   - Strong bases/irreversible conditions → kinetic control
   - Weak bases/reversible conditions → thermodynamic control

2. Temperature:
   - Higher temperatures promote equilibration
   - Lower temperatures can "freeze" kinetic product distributions

## Example: Base-Catalyzed Isomerization

A classic example of kinetic versus thermodynamic control is the base-catalyzed isomerization of substituted cyclohexanones:

- With LDA (strong base) in DME:
  - Product A (kinetic): 99%
  - Product B (thermodynamic): 1%

- With triethylamine (weak base) in DMF:
  - Product A (kinetic): 22%
  - Product B (thermodynamic): 78%

This difference arises because:

1. The less hindered position (Product A) has lower activation energy
2. The more substituted alkene (Product B) is thermodynamically more stable
3. Strong bases make the reaction effectively irreversible (kinetic control)
4. Weak bases allow equilibration (thermodynamic control)
