## Elementary Processes

Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of one of more single-step &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; processes.

For example, for the reaction $\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{Br}_2 \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{HBr}$, where the empirical rate law is given by \@ref(eq:HBrratelaw), one sequence of elementary processes that is consistent with this rate law is

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{Br}_2 & \longrightarrow & \mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{Br}^\bullet \\
\mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{H}_2 & \longrightarrow & \mathrm{H}^\bullet + \mathrm{HBr} \\
\mathrm{H}^\bullet + \mathrm{Br}_2 & \longrightarrow & \mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{HBr} \\
\mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{Br}^\bullet & \longrightarrow & \mathrm{Br}_2
(\#eq:HBrmechanism)
\end{eqnarray}

### Molecularity

Elementary processes can be classified according to their **molecularity** &mdash; the number of reactant molecules that must come together for a particular reaction step. For example, in reaction mechanism \@ref(eq:HBrmechanism), the first step involves the dissociation of Br~2~ to form two Br radicals:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Br}_2 \longrightarrow \mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{Br}^\bullet
\end{equation}

This reaction step involves a single reactant molecule, so it is described a **unimolecular**.

The second step involves a Br radical and H~2~ molecule reacting:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{H}_2 \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^\bullet + \mathrm{HBr}
\end{equation}

Because two reactant molecules must come together for this step, this is described as a **bimolecular** process.

A process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species, as in the last step of the reaction mechanism above, is also bimolecular:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Br}^\bullet + \mathrm{Br}^\bullet \longrightarrow \mathrm{Br}_2
\end{equation}

### Rate Laws for Elementary Processes

The rate laws for elementary processes directly reflect their molecularity. Unimolecular processes ($\mathrm{A} \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}$) show first-order kinetics with rate $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]$. Similarly, bimolecular processes show second-order kinetics: for a bimolecular process involving two distinct chemical species ($\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}$), the process is first-order with respect to each species: $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]$, while a bimolecular process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species ($2\mathrm{A} \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}$) is second-order with respect to that species: $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^2$.

Termolecular processes, involving three reactant molecules, show third order kinetics, e.g., $\nu = k[\mathrm{A}]^2[\mathrm{B}]$. In general, termolecular processes are rare, because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with the correct orientation is very small. While termolecular processes can play a role at very high pressure, under more typical reaction conditions, experimental observations of third-order kinetics are often better explained by a complex multistep reaction mechanism.
