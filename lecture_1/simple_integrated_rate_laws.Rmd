## Integrating Simple Rate Laws {#sec:simpleint}

For simple rate laws of the form

$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\mathrm{A}]^n$$

we can derive corresponding integrated rate laws by integrating (see CH12002 Lecture 3).

### First-Order Reactions

For a first-order process $\mathrm{A} \longrightarrow \mathrm{B}$, the rate of change of concentration of reactant, A, is given by

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\mathrm{A}]
\end{equation}

To derive the corresponding integrated rate law, we rearrange this to form an integral equation:

\begin{equation}
\int_{[\mathrm{A}]_0}^{\mathrm[A]_t} \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]}\,\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}] = \int_0^t -k\,\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}

where the limits of the integral with respect to concentration of A are between the concentration at time $0$ ($[\mathrm{A}]_0$) and the concentration at time $t$ ($[\mathrm{A}]_t$), and the limits of the integral with respect to time are between $t=0$ and $t=t$.

Integrating, using the integral $\int \frac{1}{x}\,\mathrm{d}x = \ln x$, gives

\begin{equation}
\ln [\mathrm{A}]_t - \ln [\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt
\end{equation}

which can be rearranged as

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{A}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0\mathrm{e}^{-kt}
(\#eq:concA)
\end{equation}

Hence, for a first-order process, the concentration of the reactant decays exponentially with time.

Having derived an expression for $[\mathrm{A}]_t$ we can now derive the integrated rate law for the concentration of the product, B, as a function of time. To do so, we use the known stoichoimetry of the reaction: for every molecule of A consumed, one molecule of B is formed, so the total concentration $[\mathrm{A}] + [\mathrm{B}]$ must be constant. Furthermore, when $t=0$, only A is present, with a concentration $[\mathrm{A}]_0$. So, $[\mathrm{A}] + [\mathrm{B}] = [\mathrm{A}]_0$.

Substituting in our expression for $[\mathrm{A}]$ (Eqn. \@ref(eq:concA) gives

\begin{eqnarray}
[\mathrm{B}] & = & [\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\mathrm{A}]_0\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\
             & = & [\mathrm{A}]_0\left(1-\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

Hence, for a first-order process, the concentration of the product exponentially approaches a limit of $[\mathrm{B}]_t = [\mathrm{A}]_0$.

### Second-Order Reactions

For a second-order process $2\mathrm{A} \longrightarrow \mathrm{B}$, with overall rate $\nu = \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$, the rate of change of concentration of reactant, A, is

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -2k[\mathrm{A}]^2
(\#eq:secondorderdiff)
\end{equation}


As for first-order reactions, above, we can derive the corresponding integrated rate law for $[\mathrm{A}]_t$ by rearranging Eqn. \@ref(eq:secondorderdiff) and then integrating:

\begin{equation}
\int_{[\mathrm{A}]_0}^{\mathrm[A]_t} \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{[\mathrm{A}]^2}\,\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}] = \int_0^t -k\,\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}

Integrating, using the integral $\int \frac{1}{x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x = -\frac{1}{x}$, gives

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_t} - \frac{1}{[\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt
\end{equation}

which can be rearranged as

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{A}]_t = \frac{[\mathrm{A}]_0}{1 + kt[\mathrm{A}]_0}
\end{equation}

To obtain an expression for $[\mathrm{B}]_t$, we again use our knowledge of the reaction stoichiometry and initial conditions: we start with only the reactant A, and at any stage of the reaction, the amount of B formed is equal to half the amount of A consumed.

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{B}]_t = \frac{1}{2}\left([\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\mathrm{A}]_t\right)
\end{equation}

And, so

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{B}]_t = \frac{[\mathrm{A}]_0}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{1+kt[\mathrm{A}_0]}\right)
\end{equation}

which rearranges to

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{B}]_t = \frac{kt[\mathrm{A}]_0^2}{2(1 + kt[\mathrm{A}]_0)}
\end{equation}

#### Aside: Why Does Our Second-Order Rate Equation Include a Factor of 2? {-}

Let us briefly examine the origin of the factor of 2 on the right-hand side of Eqn. \@ref{eq:secondorderdiff}. Writing the rate equation for $\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$ in this way is consistent with the convention in Section \@ref(sec:reaction-rates), that the overall rate of a reaction is related to the rates of change of specific reactants or products by

\begin{equation}
\nu = \frac{1}{n_\mathrm{X}}\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{X}]}{\mathrm{d}t}
(\#eq:relativerates)
\end{equation}

We can also justify the factor of $2$ by recognising that the stoichiometry of the reaction requires 2 molecules of A to be consumed for every 1 molecule of B formed, and, hence,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = 2\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t}
\end{equation}

The factor of 2 in Eqn. \@ref(eq:secondorderdiff) is somewhat arbitrary though, as it is a consequence of our choice to define the overall rate of reaction as $\nu = \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{B}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$. If, instead, we define our overall rate as $\nu = \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$ then we would write the rate of change of concentration of A as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\mathrm{A}]^2
(\#eq:secondorderdiff-alt)
\end{equation}

The functional form for $\frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{A}]}{\mathrm{d}t}$ is the same in both cases (Eqns. \@ref(eq:secondorderdiff) and \@ref(eq:secondorderdiff-alt). Our choice of how we define our overall rate, however, determines what the rate constant $k$ actually describes. The rate constant in \@ref(eq:secondorderdiff-alt) is equal to twice the rate constant in \@ref(eq:secondorderdiff). Upon reflection, it should perhaps not be surprising that the numerical value of our rate constant $k$ depends on how we choose to define the reaction rate. Whichever of these two ways we choose to define our overall rate, the procedure for deriving the second-order intergrated rate law is unchanged, and we end up with the same functional form for the integrated rate law &mdash; either with, or without, the factor of 2 carried through the derivation.
