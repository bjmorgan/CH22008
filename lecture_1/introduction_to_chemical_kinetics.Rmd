## Why Study Chemical Kinetics?

Chemical kinetics describes how reactions happen. While thermodynamics tells us whether a reaction will occur and what the final state will be, kinetics reveals how fast it happens and what steps are involved.

For any reaction A $\longrightarrow$ B, kinetics lets us predict how much B we'll have after a given time, or how long we need to wait for a desired yield. Beyond this, understanding kinetics helps us control and optimize reactions by changing conditions like temperature and pressure.

```{r fig-yield, fig.cap="A plot of concentrations of reactant A and product B for a generic reaction A $\\longrightarrow$ B as a function of time. Over time, A is converted to B. How long will it take to obtain 90% yield?", out.width='35%', fig.align='center'}

```

```{r fig-changingconditions, fig.cap="If we increase the temperature we (usually) expect our reaction to speed up. But by how much? If we increase the reaction temperature by 10 K, how much faster can we reach 90% yield?", out.width='35%', fig.align='center'}
