## A Molecular Theory of Reaction Rates {#sec:intro}

Our study of chemical kinetics aims to predict reaction rates from fundamental molecular principles. While collision theory provides some insight into gas-phase bimolecular reactions by modelling molecules as colliding spheres, it leaves key questions unanswered. We cannot predict steric factors without experimental data, and we lack understanding of why activation energies vary systematically within families of reactions.

Consider a bimolecular reaction A + B → P. The reaction coordinate diagram shows how the energy changes as reactant molecules A and B come together to form product P. At the highest point on this energy profile—the top of the activation barrier—the molecular system passes through what we call the transition state. Molecules at the transition state form what we call an activated complex, which we denote as C$^\ddagger$.

## Basic Principles of Transition State Theory {#sec:tst-principles}

Transition state theory makes two fundamental assumptions:

1. There exists a pseudo-equilibrium between the reactants (A + B) and the activated complex (C$^{\ddagger}$)
  - Note: This is termed a "pseudo-equilibrium" because the activated complex is dynamically unstable.
  - C$^{\ddagger}$ can either break apart back to A + B or convert to products P.
2. There is a characteristic rate constant $k^{\ddagger}$ that describes the conversion of the activated complex to products
  - This is a first-order process: $\nu = \frac{\mathrm{d}[\mathrm{P}]}{\mathrm{d}t} = k^{\ddagger}[\mathrm{C}^{\ddagger}]$.

We can represent this process as a two-step scheme:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}^{\ddagger} \xrightarrow{k^{\ddagger}} \mathrm{P}
(#eq:tst-scheme)
\end{equation}

## Mathematical Development of Transition State Theory {#sec:tst-math}

To develop our rate equation, we begin by considering the pseudo-equilibrium between reactants and the activated complex. We can define a pseudo-equilibrium constant:

\begin{equation}
K^{\ddagger} = \frac{[\mathrm{C}^{\ddagger}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}
(\#eq:equilibrium-constant)
\end{equation}

This allows us to express the concentration of the activated complex in terms of reactant concentrations:

\begin{equation}
[\mathrm{C}^{\ddagger}] = K^{\ddagger}[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]
(\#eq:activated-complex-conc)
\end{equation}

Like any equilibrium constant, $K^{\ddagger}$ is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change:

\begin{equation}
\Delta G^{\ddagger} = -RT\ln(K^{\ddagger}c^{\circ})
(#eq:gibbs-activation)
\end{equation}

where $c^{\circ}$ is a reference concentration (typically 1 mol dm$^{-3}$).^[If our reaction takes place under standard conditions, $c^\circ=1,\mathrm{mol},\mathrm{dm}^{-3}$ and has no effect on the numerical value of $k$. Because of this, c$^\circ$ is often omitted in basic treatments of Transition State Theory, so you might see examples where it is missing. Including $c^\circ$, however, ensures that $k$ has the correct units for a second-order rate constant (dm$^3$ mol$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$).]

Since $\Delta G^{\ddagger} = \Delta H^{\ddagger} - T\Delta S^{\ddagger}$, we can write:

\begin{equation}
K^{\ddagger} = \frac{1}{c^{\circ}}\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger}/RT} = \frac{1}{c^{\circ}}\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger}/RT}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R}
(\#eq:equilibrium-constant-expanded)
\end{equation}

From our second assumption, the rate of product formation is proportional to the concentration of the activated complex:

\begin{equation}
\nu = k^{\ddagger}[\mathrm{C}^{\ddagger}] = \frac{k^{\ddagger}}{c^{\circ}}[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R}\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger}/RT}
(\#eq:tst-rate)
\end{equation}

This has the form of a second-order rate law with rate constant:

\begin{equation}
k = \frac{k^{\ddagger}}{c^{\circ}}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R}\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger}/RT}
(\#eq:tst-rate-constant)
\end{equation}

## Relationship to the Arrhenius Equation {#sec:tst-arrhenius}

We can understand how transition state theory connects to experimental observations by comparing the rate constant expression with the Arrhenius equation:

From transition state theory:
\begin{equation}
k = \frac{k^{\ddagger}}{c^{\circ}}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R}\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger}/RT}
(#eq:tst-k)
\end{equation}

The Arrhenius equation:
\begin{equation}
k = A\mathrm{e}^{-E_\mathrm{a}/RT}
(#eq:arrhenius)
\end{equation}

This comparison reveals two important correspondences:

- The activation enthalpy $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ plays a similar role to the Arrhenius activation energy $E_\mathrm{a}$.
- The pre-exponential factor $A$ corresponds to $\frac{k^{\ddagger}}{c^{\circ}}\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R}$.

Like collision theory, transition state theory provides a molecular-level interpretation of the Arrhenius parameters. However, transition state theory offers additional insight by separating the activation barrier into enthalpic ($\Delta H^{\ddagger}$) and entropic ($\Delta S^{\ddagger}$) contributions, helping explain systematic variations in reactivity across related compounds.

## Enthalpy of Activation {#sec:enthalpy-activation}

Understanding $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ provides insight into activation energies and their systematic variation across related reactions. Consider the simple reaction A–B + C → A + B–C. In forming the activated complex:

- The A–B bond is mostly broken
- The B–C bond is partially formed
- Therefore, $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ is:
  - Strongly dependent on the strength of bonds being broken
  - Weakly dependent on the strength of bonds being formed

This principle helps explain trends in activation energies for a family of related reactions. Consider these examples involving H and Br:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{H–H} + \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{H} + \mathrm{H–H} & E_\mathrm{a} &= +39~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\
\mathrm{H–H} + \mathrm{Br} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{H} + \mathrm{H–Br} & E_\mathrm{a} &= +82~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\
\mathrm{Br–H} + \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{Br} + \mathrm{H–H} & E_\mathrm{a} &= +12~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\
\mathrm{Br–Br} + \mathrm{H} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{Br} + \mathrm{Br–H} & E_\mathrm{a} &= +4~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}
\end{align*}

To understand these trends, we need to consider the bond dissociation energies:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{H–H}: & ~E_\mathrm{d} = +436~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\
\mathrm{H–Br}: & ~E_\mathrm{d} = +366~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\
\mathrm{Br–Br}: & ~E_\mathrm{d} = +193~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}
\end{align*}

The trends in activation energy can be explained by:

1. The first two reactions involve breaking H–H bonds (highest $E_\mathrm{d}$) → highest $E_\mathrm{a}$ values
2. Between these two:
   - H–H + H forms H–H (more favorable)
   - H–H + Br forms H–Br (less favorable)
   - Therefore $E_\mathrm{a}$ is lower for H–H + H

3. The remaining reactions follow the trend in bond strength being broken:
   - Breaking H–Br ($E_\mathrm{a} = +12~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}$)
   - Breaking Br–Br ($E_\mathrm{a} = +4~\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}$)

## Reconciling TST with Collision Theory {#sec:tst-collision}

Our two theories provide different physical interpretations of activation energy:

- Collision theory: $E_\mathrm{a}$ represents a threshold kinetic energy
- TST: $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ represents energy stored in partially broken/formed bonds

These interpretations can be reconciled by considering the energy changes during a reactive collision:

1. Initial state:
   - Separated molecules with relative KE ≥ $E_\mathrm{a}$
   - Undistorted internal bonds

2. At the transition state:
   - Relative KE has been converted to potential energy
   - Energy stored in partially broken/formed bonds
   - Distorted molecular geometries

Therefore:

- Collision theory $E_\mathrm{a}$ describes the minimum energy input required.
- TST $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$ describes where that energy ends up.
- These must be approximately equal by energy conservation.

The two theories thus provide complementary perspectives on the same process:
- Collision theory focuses on what energy must go in
- TST focuses on where that energy ends up and how it affects molecular structure
