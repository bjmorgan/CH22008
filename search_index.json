Chemical kinetics describes how reactions happen. While thermodynamics tells us whether a reaction will occur and what the final state will be, kinetics reveals how fast it happens and what steps are involved. For any reaction A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B, kinetics lets us predict how much B we’ll have after a given time, or how long we need to wait for a desired yield. Beyond this, understanding kinetics helps us control and optimize reactions by changing conditions like temperature and pressure. Figure 1.1: A plot of concentrations of reactant A and product B for a generic reaction A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B as a function of time. Over time, A is converted to B. How long will it take to obtain 90% yield? Figure 1.2: If we increase the temperature we (usually) expect our reaction to speed up. But by how much? If we increase the reaction temperature by 10 K, how much faster can we reach 90% yield? 1.2 Reaction Rates A core concept in chemical kinetics is the idea of a reaction rate — the speed at which chemical change happens. We express reaction rates mathematically as derivatives of the form \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\), representing the change in concentration of a species X with time. This rate can be positive (for products being formed) or negative (for reactants being consumed). For any reaction that does not have a 1:1 stoichiometry ratio between all reactants and products, the numerical “rate” will depend on the chemical species we choose to define this. For example, for the reaction \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{B} \\end{equation}\\] the product, B, is formed at twice the rate that the reactant, A, is consumed. Hence, \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] In general, we can define an “overall” reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) that is related to the rates of change of reactants and products by \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n_\\mathrm{X}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n_\\mathrm{X}\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species \\(X\\) in the reaction equation. 1.3 Simple Rate Equations For many reactions, the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants, raised to some power; i.e., \\[\\nu = k [\\mathrm{A}]^a [\\mathrm{B}]^b [\\mathrm{C}]^c \\ldots\\] The proportionality constant, \\(k\\), is called the rate constant. The exponents, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) …, describe the order of the reaction with respect to the reactants A, B, C …. So, for a reaction \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C}\\] with rate equation (or “rate law”) \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2[\\mathrm{B}]\\], we would describe this as being second-order with respect to A, and first-order with respect to B. For rate equations that have the simple form above, we can define an overall order, which is the sum of the individual orders with respect to each of the reactants. In the example above, this reaction would be described as being third-order overall, since \\(a+b = 3\\). Not all reactions follow simple rate laws. For example, the reaction between H2 and Br2 to form HBr has an empirically-determined rate law \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^\\frac{1}{2}}{1+k^\\prime [\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br}_2]} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] This rate law is first-order with respect to H2, because \\(\\nu \\propto [\\mathrm{H_2}]\\). But we cannot define an order with respect to Br2, because the overall rate is not simply proportional to \\([\\mathrm{Br}_2]\\) raised to some power. Instead, we would describe the order with respect to Br2 as being undefined. This means the overall order is also undefined, since we cannot simply add the orders with respect to H2 and Br2. 1.4 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of one of more single-step “elementary” processes. For example, for the reaction \\(\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr}\\), where the empirical rate law is given by (1.1), one sequence of elementary processes that is consistent with this rate law is \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\\\ \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{H}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\tag{1.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] 1.4.1 Molecularity Elementary processes can be classified according to their molecularity — the number of reactant molecules that must come together for a particular reaction step. For example, in reaction mechanism (1.2), the first step involves the dissociation of Br2 to form two Br radicals: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\end{equation}\\] This reaction step involves a single reactant molecule, so it is described a unimolecular. The second step involves a Br radical and H2 molecule reacting: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\end{equation}\\] Because two reactant molecules must come together for this step, this is described as a bimolecular process. A process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species, as in the last step of the reaction mechanism above, is also bimolecular: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\end{equation}\\] 1.4.2 Rate Laws for Elementary Processes The rate laws for elementary processes directly reflect their molecularity. Unimolecular processes (\\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)) show first-order kinetics with rate \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\). Similarly, bimolecular processes show second-order kinetics: for a bimolecular process involving two distinct chemical species (\\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)), the process is first-order with respect to each species: \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\), while a bimolecular process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species (\\(2\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)) is second-order with respect to that species: \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\). Termolecular processes, involving three reactant molecules, show third order kinetics, e.g., \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2[\\mathrm{B}]\\). In general, termolecular processes are rare, because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with the correct orientation is very small. While termolecular processes can play a role at very high pressure, under more typical reaction conditions, experimental observations of third-order kinetics are often better explained by a complex multistep reaction mechanism. 1.5 Moving Between Concentration and Rate Perspectives The progression of any chemical reaction can be viewed from two complementary perspectives: the concentration of species as they change over time, \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\), and the instantaneous rates at which these changes occur, \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]/\\mathrm{d}t\\). These two perspectives both describe the same underlying chemical process, just viewed through different mathematical lenses. Consider a reactant A being consumed during a reaction. We might track its concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) as it decreases over time, giving us a curve of concentration versus time. At any point on this curve, we can determine the instantaneous rate of reaction by finding the slope of the tangent line. Mathematically, this is equivalent to computing the derivative of \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\), i.e., \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\). Since we are dealing with the concentration of a reactant, the reaction rate is then the negative of this derivative (since the concentrations of A decreases with time): \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] We can also go the other way from a description of rate to a description of the concentration profile over time. Mathematically we do this by integration, which is the inverse operation to differentiation. By integrating a rate, we effectively sum all the small changes in concentration over some time interval. For example, the change in concentration of A from the start of a reaction at \\(t=0\\) is given by \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = \\int_0^t -\\nu(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] Whether we work in terms of concentrations or rates depends on the question we are trying to answer, what information we have available to us, and whether it is more mathematically convenient to work with one than the other. Figure 1.3: If we know the concentration of a reactant or product as a function of time we can calculate the rate of change of this concentration by differentiation. We can also calculate how concentrations vary in time from rates by the inverse procedure, integration. 1.6 Integrating Simple Rate Laws For simple rate laws of the form \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^n\\] we can derive corresponding integrated rate laws by integrating (see CH12002 Lecture 3). 1.6.1 First-Order Reactions For a first-order process \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\), the rate of change of concentration of reactant, A, is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}] \\end{equation}\\] To derive the corresponding integrated rate law, we rearrange this to form an integral equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{\\mathrm[A]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]}\\,\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\end{equation}\\] where the limits of the integral with respect to concentration of A are between the concentration at time \\(0\\) (\\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\)) and the concentration at time \\(t\\) (\\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\)), and the limits of the integral with respect to time are between \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=t\\). Integrating, using the integral \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\ln x\\), gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln [\\mathrm{A}]_t - \\ln [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt \\end{equation}\\] which can be rearranged as \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\tag{1.5} \\end{equation}\\] Hence, for a first-order process, the concentration of the reactant decays exponentially with time. Having derived an expression for \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) we can now derive the integrated rate law for the concentration of the product, B, as a function of time. To do so, we use the known stoichoimetry of the reaction: for every molecule of A consumed, one molecule of B is formed, so the total concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}] + [\\mathrm{B}]\\) must be constant. Furthermore, when \\(t=0\\), only A is present, with a concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). So, \\([\\mathrm{A}] + [\\mathrm{B}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). Substituting in our expression for \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) (Eqn. (1.5) gives \\[\\begin{eqnarray} [\\mathrm{B}] &amp; = &amp; [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\\\ &amp; = &amp; [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\\right) \\end{eqnarray}\\] Hence, for a first-order process, the concentration of the product exponentially approaches a limit of \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). Figure 1.4: Concentrations as a function of time for a first-order process \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). 1.6.2 Second-Order Reactions For a second-order process \\(2\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\), with overall rate \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\), the rate of change of concentration of reactant, A, is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2k[\\mathrm{A}]^2 \\tag{1.6} \\end{equation}\\] As for first-order reactions, above, we can derive the corresponding integrated rate law for \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) by rearranging Eqn. (1.6) and then integrating: \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{\\mathrm[A]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\end{equation}\\] Integrating, using the integral \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{1}{x}\\), gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} - \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt \\end{equation}\\] which can be rearranged as \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{1 + kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0} \\end{equation}\\] To obtain an expression for \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t\\), we again use our knowledge of the reaction stoichiometry and initial conditions: we start with only the reactant A, and at any stage of the reaction, the amount of B formed is equal to half the amount of A consumed. \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{1}{2}\\left([\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_t\\right) \\end{equation}\\] And, so \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1+kt[\\mathrm{A}_0]}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] which rearranges to \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0^2}{2(1 + kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0)} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 1.5: Concentrations as a function of time for a second-order process \\(2\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). The dashed line shows the sum \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\). Aside: Why Does Our Second-Order Rate Equation Include a Factor of 2? Let us briefly examine the origin of the factor of 2 on the right-hand side of Eqn. @ref{eq:secondorderdiff}. Writing the rate equation for \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) in this way is consistent with the convention in Section 1.2, that the overall rate of a reaction is related to the rates of change of specific reactants or products by \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = \\frac{1}{n_\\mathrm{X}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\tag{1.7} \\end{equation}\\] We can also justify the factor of \\(2\\) by recognising that the stoichiometry of the reaction requires 2 molecules of A to be consumed for every 1 molecule of B formed, and, hence, \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\end{equation}\\] The factor of 2 in Eqn. (1.6) is somewhat arbitrary though, as it is a consequence of our choice to define the overall rate of reaction as \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\). If, instead, we define our overall rate as \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) then we would write the rate of change of concentration of A as \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^2 \\tag{1.8} \\end{equation}\\] The functional form for \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) is the same in both cases (Eqns. (1.6) and (1.8). Our choice of how we define our overall rate, however, determines what the rate constant \\(k\\) actually describes. The rate constant in (1.8) is equal to twice the rate constant in (1.6). Upon reflection, it should perhaps not be surprising that the numerical value of our rate constant \\(k\\) depends on how we choose to define the reaction rate. Whichever of these two ways we choose to define our overall rate, the procedure for deriving the second-order intergrated rate law is unchanged, and we end up with the same functional form for the integrated rate law — either with, or without, the factor of 2 carried through the derivation. 1.7 From Mechanisms to Rate Laws The relationship between reaction mechanisms and the time evolution of chemical concentrations depends strongly on the complexity of the reaction scheme. For reactions that consist of a single elementary process, we can usually determine how the concentrations of reactants and products evolve with time through a straightforward two-step process: Write down the rate equations for reactants and products based on the molecularity of the elementary process Directly integrate these rate equations to obtain the corresponding integrated rate laws For example, we have already seen how this works for first-order processes in Section 1.6. For reactions with multistep mechanisms, however, the path from mechanism to time evolution is often more complex. Our starting point is always the reaction mechanism itself—the sequence of elementary processes that describes the complete reaction scheme. From this mechanism, we write differential rate equations for all chemical species that appear, including not only the reactants and products, but also any reaction intermediates. When analysing multistep mechanisms, we typically pursue one or both of two goals: To derive an expression for the overall reaction rate in terms of reactant concentrations only, eliminating any dependence on intermediate concentrations To obtain integrated rate laws that describe how the concentrations of reactants and products vary with time How we approach these goals depends on the nature of the reaction mechanism under consideration. In general, we can analyse complex reaction mechanisms using one of three strategies: 1.7.1 Exact Solutions For some reaction mechanisms, we can derive exact analytical solutions to our coupled differential rate equations. While this approach is the most mathematically satisfying, it is only possible for relatively simple reaction schemes. 1.7.2 Approximate Analytical Solutions More commonly, we can simplify our set of coupled differential equations by applying chemical approximations based on the physical nature of the reaction mechanism. We then solve these simplified equations to obtain analytical solutions that accurately describe the real system within the range of conditions where our approximations hold. This approach often provides valuable chemical insight into the factors controlling reaction rates and time evolution. 1.7.3 Numerical Integration When analytical solutions prove intractable, we can always fall back on numerical methods. By numerically integrating our differential rate equations, we can model how the concentrations of all species—reactants, products, and intermediates—evolve over time. While this approach will always work in principle, it may provide less direct insight into the underlying chemical processes than analytical solutions, even approximate ones. Although numerical integration provides a reliable method of last resort, there is often significant value in pursuing analytical solutions, either exact or approximate. These solutions can reveal fundamental relationships between reaction parameters and chemical behavior that might be obscured in purely numerical results.

These are called parallel reactions. The simplest example is where a reactant A can form either product B or product C: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{B}\\] \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] Understanding how these parallel reactions proceed and what controls their relative rates is crucial for many practical applications, particularly in synthetic chemistry where we often want to maximize the yield of one product over another. 2.2 Simple First-Order Parallel Reactions Let us first consider the case of a single first-order reaction: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k} \\mathrm{B}\\] The rate equations are: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Integrating these gives: \\[[\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\\] And since [B] = [A]0 - [A] (from conservation of mass): \\[[\\mathrm{B}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-kt})\\] 2.3 First-Order Parallel Reactions For parallel reactions where both pathways are first-order: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{B}\\] \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] The rate of change of A is now: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(k_1 + k_2)[\\mathrm{A}]\\] Integrating this gives: \\[[\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-(k_1+k_2)t}\\] For product B: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}] = k_1[\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-(k_1+k_2)t}\\] Integrating: \\[[\\mathrm{B}] = \\frac{k_1}{k_1+k_2}[\\mathrm{A}]_0(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-(k_1+k_2)t})\\] Similarly for C: \\[[\\mathrm{C}] = \\frac{k_2}{k_1+k_2}[\\mathrm{A}]_0(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-(k_1+k_2)t})\\] 2.4 Key Features of Parallel Reactions Several important points emerge from these expressions: The formation of both products B and C is controlled by the same overall rate constant (\\(k_1 + k_2\\)) The relative yields of products are determined by the ratio of the rate constants: \\[\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{C}]} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\] This ratio is often called the selectivity, S: \\[S = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\] 2.5 Temperature Effects on Selectivity How does changing temperature affect the selectivity? Using the Arrhenius equation: \\[k_1 = A_1\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_1}{RT}\\right)\\] \\[k_2 = A_2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_2}{RT}\\right)\\] Therefore: \\[S = \\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\frac{A_1}{A_2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_1-\\Delta E_2}{RT}\\right)\\] If ΔE1 &gt; ΔE2, then (ΔE1-ΔE2) is positive, and increasing temperature will increase S. This can be visualized using an Arrhenius plot (ln k vs 1/T), where the reaction with the higher activation energy has the steeper slope. 2.6 Pressure Effects on Selectivity The effect of pressure on selectivity depends on the molecularity of the competing reactions: If both reactions have the same molecularity (e.g., both first-order), pressure has no effect on selectivity because k is independent of pressure. For reactions with different molecularity: \\[\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_1} \\mathrm{B}\\] \\[2\\mathrm{A} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\mathrm{C}\\] The selectivity becomes pressure-dependent: \\[\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{C}]} = \\frac{\\text{rate}_\\mathrm{B}}{\\text{rate}_\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{k_1[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_2[\\mathrm{A}]^2} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2[\\mathrm{A}]}\\] Following Le Chatelier’s principle, increasing pressure favors the reaction with the higher molecularity. 2.7 Applications Parallel reactions are particularly important in synthetic chemistry. For example, in the selective nitration of phenol (C6H5OH), controlling temperature and other conditions can direct the nitration to favor either ortho- or para- substitution. Understanding how reaction conditions affect selectivity allows chemists to optimize yields of desired products while minimizing unwanted side products.

The relative yields of products are determined by the ratio of the forward rate constants: \\[\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{C}]} \\approx \\frac{k_1}{k_2}\\] This is often called “kinetic control”, as the product distribution is determined by the relative rates of the forward reactions. 3.2.2 Long-Time Behaviour At long times, the system reaches equilibrium, where: \\[\\frac{d[\\mathrm{A}]}{dt} = \\frac{d[\\mathrm{B}]}{dt} = \\frac{d[\\mathrm{C}]}{dt} = 0\\] At equilibrium: \\[k_1[\\mathrm{A}]_\\mathrm{eq} = k_{-1}[\\mathrm{B}]_\\mathrm{eq}\\] \\[k_2[\\mathrm{A}]_\\mathrm{eq} = k_{-2}[\\mathrm{C}]_\\mathrm{eq}\\] This gives equilibrium constants: \\[K_\\mathrm{AB} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_\\mathrm{eq}}{[\\mathrm{A}]_\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}\\] \\[K_\\mathrm{AC} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{C}]_\\mathrm{eq}}{[\\mathrm{A}]_\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_2}{k_{-2}}\\] The final product ratio at equilibrium is: \\[\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]_\\mathrm{eq}}{[\\mathrm{C}]_\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{k_1k_{-2}}{k_{-1}k_2}\\] This is called “thermodynamic control”, as the product distribution is determined by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the products. 3.3 Kinetic vs Thermodynamic Control The evolution from kinetic to thermodynamic control can be understood by considering how the energy of a molecular system changes as reactants transform to products. Figure 3.1: A reaction coordinate diagram showing the free energy profile for a chemical reaction. The reaction coordinate represents the progression through molecular geometric changes (e.g., bonds breaking and forming) as reactants transform into products. The activation energy (\\(\\Delta G_\\mathrm{a}\\)) determines reaction rate, while the reaction free energy (\\(\\Delta G_\\mathrm{r}\\)) determines the position of equilibrium. Figure 3.1 shows an example of a reaction coordinate diagram. A reaction coordinate diagram is a schematic representation of how the free energy of a molecular system changes as a reaction proceeds. The horizontal axis is called the reaction coordinate, and represents the progression of the reaction along a particular reaction pathway—often this corresponds to a specific change in geometry as atoms rearrange and bonds break and form. The vertical axis shows the Gibbs free energy of the system. Two key features of these diagrams help us understand reaction behaviour: The activation energy (\\(\\Delta G_\\mathrm{a}\\)) represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for reaction to occur. This determines reaction rate—lower barriers mean faster reactions. The reaction free energy (\\(\\Delta G_\\mathrm{r}\\)) represents the overall thermodynamic driving force. This determines the position of equilibrium—more negative values mean the products are more favoured at equilibrium. For our parallel reactions, the diagram shows two paths starting from reactant A: one leading to product B and another to product C. Consider a system where: Product B has the lower activation energy (faster formation, kinetic product) Product C has the lower free energy (more stable, thermodynamic product) At short times, B forms more rapidly due to its lower activation barrier. However, if the reaction is reversible (small enough barriers for reverse reactions), the system will eventually equilibrate to favour the more thermodynamically stable product C. Important factors that determine whether kinetic or thermodynamic control dominates: Reaction conditions: Strong bases/irreversible conditions → kinetic control Weak bases/reversible conditions → thermodynamic control Temperature: Higher temperatures promote equilibration Lower temperatures can “freeze” kinetic product distributions 3.4 Example: Base-Catalyzed Isomerization A classic example of kinetic versus thermodynamic control is the base-catalyzed isomerization of substituted cyclohexanones: With LDA (strong base) in DME: Product A (kinetic): 99% Product B (thermodynamic): 1% With triethylamine (weak base) in DMF: Product A (kinetic): 22% Product B (thermodynamic): 78% This difference arises because: The less hindered position (Product A) has lower activation energy The more substituted alkene (Product B) is thermodynamically more stable Strong bases make the reaction effectively irreversible (kinetic control) Weak bases allow equilibration (thermodynamic control) "],["lecture4.html", "Lecture 4 Numerical Integration 4.1 From Mechanisms to Kinetic Data 4.2 The Role of Integration in Chemical Kinetics 4.3 Principles of Numerical Integration 4.4 Sources of Error 4.5 Practical Implementation", " Lecture 4 Numerical Integration 4.1 From Mechanisms to Kinetic Data One reason to study the kinetics of reactions is beacause kinetic data can provide us with information about reaction mechanisms. Often, we start by collecting experimental concentration-time data for some reaction, and using this to deduce an empirical rate law (see CH12002 Lecture 4). Once we have an empirical rate law, this can inform our thinking around possible reaction mechanisms. The rate law may be of the same form as for another reaction where we know the mechanism, and so we propose that our current reaction proceeds by an equivalent mechanism. Or our empirical rate law simply acts as a constraint: any proposed mechanisms must give a theoretical rate law that is consistent with out experimentally deduced rate law. Alternatively, we might start from some hypothetical reaction mechanism: perhaps proposed on the basis of some prior chemical knowledge we have about our specific reaction. From this proposed mechanism, we can predict the shape of concentration-time profiles we would expect in experiments, given that our mechanism is correct, and then compare our predicted concentration-time profiles to those obtained from experiments. If we find good agreement between our predicted concetration-time data and those recorded experimentally then this provides support for our proposed mechanism being correct. If our predicted concentration-time data, however, do not agree with our experimental results — in particular, if the predicted and experimental concentration-time profiles have qualitatively different shapes — then we can reject the proposed mechanism on the basis that it is inconsistent with experiment. 4.2 The Role of Integration in Chemical Kinetics For simple reaction mechanisms, we can often derive analytical expressions for how concentrations change with time. Consider a first-order reaction \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). The differential rate equation is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}] \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] and we can solve this by integration to obtain \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] However, for many reaction mechanisms, deriving analytical solutions becomes either extremely difficult or impossible. Consider, for example, the Lindemann mechanism for a unimolecular reaction: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M} &amp;\\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}^* + \\mathrm{M} &amp; k_1,\\, k_{-1} \\\\ \\mathrm{A}^* &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P} &amp; k_2 \\end{align*}\\] The corresponding differential rate equations are: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A}^*][\\mathrm{M}] \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}^*]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A}^*][\\mathrm{M}] - k_2[\\mathrm{A}^*] \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{A}^*] \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] While we can make approximations (such as the steady-state approximation) to derive approximate analytical solutions under certain conditions, numerical integration provides a general approach that can be applied to any mechanism, regardless of its complexity. 4.3 Principles of Numerical Integration To understand how numerical integration works, let us return to our simple first-order reaction \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). The differential rate equations are: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}] \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k[\\mathrm{A}] \\tag{4.7} \\end{equation}\\] The numerical integration approach recognises that these equations tell us the instantaneous rates of change of \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\) at any point in time. If we know these rates at time \\(t\\), we can estimate the concentrations a short time later, at \\(t + \\Delta t\\): \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_{t+\\Delta t} = [\\mathrm{A}]_t + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Delta t \\tag{4.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_{t+\\Delta t} = [\\mathrm{B}]_t + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Delta t \\tag{4.9} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta t\\) is called the time step. Starting with known initial concentrations at \\(t = 0\\), we can use these equations to “step forward” in time, calculating new concentrations at each step. 4.3.1 A Simple Example Let us work through a specific example. Consider the first-order reaction above with \\(k = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) and initial conditions \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 = 1\\,\\mathrm{M}\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0\\,\\mathrm{M}\\). Using a time step \\(\\Delta t = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}\\): At \\(t = 0~\\mathrm{s}\\): \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 = 1~\\mathrm{M}\\) \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(1~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1~\\mathrm{M}) = -1~\\mathrm{M}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_{0.1} = 1~\\mathrm{M} + (-1~\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.1\\mathrm{s}) = 0.9~\\mathrm{M}\\) Similarly, \\([\\mathrm{B}]_{0.1} = 0~\\mathrm{M} + (1~\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.1\\mathrm{s}) = 0.1~\\mathrm{M}\\) At \\(t = 0.1~\\mathrm{s}\\): \\([\\mathrm{A}]_{0.1} = 0.9~\\mathrm{M}\\) \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(1~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.9~\\mathrm{M}) = -0.9~\\mathrm{M}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_{0.2} = 0.9~\\mathrm{M} + (-0.9~\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.1\\mathrm{s}) = 0.81~\\mathrm{M}\\) This process continues, giving us approximate values for \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t\\) at discrete time points. 4.4 Sources of Error The numerical integration method makes one key approximation: it assumes the reaction rates remain constant over each time step. In reality, rates change continuously as concentrations change. This approximation introduces systematic errors that become larger when: The time step \\(\\Delta t\\) is increased Reaction rates change more rapidly within each time step We can improve accuracy by: Using a smaller time step (at the cost of more computational steps) Using more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods) that better approximate the changing reaction rates 4.5 Practical Implementation The basic method described above is easily implemented in Python: def dA_by_dt(k1, A): return -k1 * A def dB_by_dt(k1, A): return +k1 * A # Initial conditions and parameters A0, B0 = 1.0, 0.0 # Initial concentrations (M) k1 = 1.0 # Rate constant (s⁻¹) dt = 0.1 # Time step (s) # Arrays to store results A_stored = [A0] B_stored = [B0] timesteps = [0] # Main integration loop t = 0 A = A0 B = B0 simulation_time = 5.0 while t &lt; simulation_time: dA = dA_by_dt(k1, A) * dt dB = dB_by_dt(k1, A) * dt A += dA B += dB A_stored.append(A) B_stored.append(B) t += dt "],["lecture5.html", "Lecture 5 Collision Theory 5.1 Introduction to Kinetic Theories 5.2 Fundamentals of Collision Theory 5.3 From Collisions to Reaction Rates 5.4 Relationship to the Arrhenius Equation 5.5 Limitations of Collision Theory as a Predictive Framework", " Lecture 5 Collision Theory 5.1 Introduction to Kinetic Theories Up to this point, we have focused on describing and interpreting empirical data—either deriving rate laws from experimental data or proposing reaction mechanisms and comparing their predictions against observations. While this approach allows us to understand the shape of concentration–time profiles, it does not explain quantitative differences in reaction rates. Several important questions remain: - For two bimolecular reactions, which would we expect to be faster, and by how much? - Can we predict rate constants \\(k\\) (and how they vary with temperature) without experimental data? While we have discussed the Arrhenius equation, \\(k = A_0\\mathrm{e}^{-\\Delta E/RT}\\), this is an approximate empirical relationship that requires experimental data to determine \\(A_0\\) and \\(\\Delta E\\). To move beyond empirical descriptions, we need microscopic theories that can make quantitative predictions of reaction rates. In this course, we will examine two such theories: Collision Theory (this lecture)—focuses on gas-phase bimolecular reactions, treating molecules as hard spheres Transition State Theory (lectures 6–9)—considers formation of activated complexes for all types of reactions 5.2 Fundamentals of Collision Theory Collision theory provides one of the simplest microscopic models of reaction rates, specifically for gas-phase bimolecular reactions of the form: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\] For such reactions, we expect a rate law of the form \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\), but what determines the value of \\(k\\)? 5.2.1 Basic Principles and Assumptions Building on the kinetic theory of gases, collision theory makes two key assumptions: Molecules behave as hard spheres Molecules must collide to react The overall reaction rate is then: rate = rate of collisions × fraction of “successful” collisions 5.2.2 Collision Frequency Consider two molecules A and B with radii \\(r_\\mathrm{A}\\) and \\(r_\\mathrm{B}\\) and velocities \\(v_\\mathrm{A}\\) and \\(v_\\mathrm{B}\\). To analyze their collisions, we can adopt the reference frame of molecule B, where: B appears stationary A moves with relative velocity \\(v = v_\\mathrm{B} - v_\\mathrm{A}\\) A collision occurs when the closest distance of approach (the “impact parameter” \\(b\\)) is less than the sum of the molecular radii: \\[b &lt; (r_\\mathrm{A} + r_\\mathrm{B}) = d\\] As molecule A moves through space, it sweeps out a cylindrical volume: Radius = \\(d = (r_\\mathrm{A} + r_\\mathrm{B})\\) Length (per unit time) = \\(v\\) (the relative velocity) Volume (per unit time) = \\(vS = v\\pi d^2\\) The collision frequency per unit volume (\\(Z&#39;\\)) is then: \\[Z&#39; = \\frac{N_\\mathrm{A}N_\\mathrm{B}}{V^2}v\\pi d^2\\] where \\(N_\\mathrm{A}\\) and \\(N_\\mathrm{B}\\) are the numbers of molecules of each species in volume \\(V\\). 5.2.3 Average Relative Velocity The relative velocity between molecules follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The average relative velocity is: \\[\\bar{v} = \\left(\\frac{8k_\\mathrm{B}T}{\\pi \\mu}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the reduced mass: \\[\\mu = \\frac{m_\\mathrm{A}m_\\mathrm{B}}{m_\\mathrm{A} + m_\\mathrm{B}}\\] Substituting this into our expression for collision frequency: \\[Z&#39; = \\frac{N_\\mathrm{A}N_\\mathrm{B}}{V^2}\\pi d^2\\left(\\frac{8k_\\mathrm{B}T}{\\pi \\mu}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}\\] 5.3 From Collisions to Reaction Rates 5.3.1 Successful Collisions Not all collisions lead to reaction. We assume a collision is successful if the relative kinetic energy exceeds a threshold activation energy \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\). For a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the fraction of collisions with sufficient energy is: \\[P(E \\geq E_\\mathrm{a}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT}\\right)\\] This gives a total reaction rate: \\[\\nu = Z&#39; \\times P(E \\geq E_\\mathrm{a}) = \\frac{N_\\mathrm{A}N_\\mathrm{B}}{V^2}\\pi d^2\\left(\\frac{8k_\\mathrm{B}T}{\\pi \\mu}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT}\\right)\\] This can be written in the familiar form of a second-order rate law: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu=k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] \\end{equation}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation} k = \\pi d^2\\left(\\frac{8k_\\mathrm{B}T}{\\pi \\mu}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] 5.3.2 Steric Factors When we compare the reaction rates predicted by collision theory with experimental measurements, we typically find that collision theory overestimates reaction rates, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This discrepancy arises because our model of molecules as hard spheres is an oversimplification—successful reactions often require specific molecular orientations or more complex interactions than simple collisions. To account for these effects, we introduce an empirical correction factor \\(P\\), called the steric factor, that modifies our expression for the rate constant: \\[\\begin{equation} k = P\\pi d^2\\left(\\frac{8k_\\mathrm{B}T}{\\pi\\mu}\\right)^{1/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT}\\right) \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] The steric factor \\(P\\) is defined as the ratio of the experimental pre-exponential factor to the theoretical value predicted by collision theory: \\[\\begin{equation} P = \\frac{A_\\mathrm{exp}}{A_\\mathrm{th}} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] Different types of reactions exhibit characteristic ranges of steric factors. Consider these examples: For the hydrogenation of ethene: H2+C2H4\\(\\longrightarrow\\)C2H6 \\(P = 1.7 \\times 10^{-6}\\). This very small steric factor reflects the strict geometric requirements for reaction—the H2 molecule must approach the C=C double bond in a specific orientation for reaction to occur. For the reaction between potassium and bromine: K+Br2\\(\\longrightarrow\\)KBr+Br \\(P = 4.8\\). Here the steric factor is greater than unity, indicating that reactions occur more frequently than predicted by simple collision theory. This enhanced reactivity arises from the “harpoon mechanism”, where electron transfer between K and Br2 creates long-range attractive forces that effectively increase the collision cross-section. 5.4 Relationship to the Arrhenius Equation The rate constant derived from collision theory has a remarkably similar form to the empirical Arrhenius equation. Let us compare them directly: From collision theory: \\[\\begin{equation} k = P\\pi d^2\\left(\\frac{8k_\\mathrm{B}T}{\\pi\\mu}\\right)^{1/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT}\\right) \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] The Arrhenius equation: \\[\\begin{equation} k = A_0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\mathrm{a}}{RT}\\right) \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] This comparison provides physical insight into the meaning of the Arrhenius parameters: The activation energy \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) in the Arrhenius equation can be interpreted as the minimum relative kinetic energy that colliding molecules must possess for reaction to occur. This threshold energy is needed to overcome the potential energy barrier to reaction. The pre-exponential factor \\(A_0\\) represents a normalized collision frequency. The collision theory expression shows that this frequency depends on: The collision cross-section (\\(\\pi d^2\\)) The average relative velocity of molecules (\\(\\propto \\sqrt{T/\\mu}\\)) A steric factor \\(P\\) that accounts for orientation requirements Therefore, while the Arrhenius equation was originally proposed as an empirical relationship, collision theory provides a theoretical foundation for its functional form and offers molecular-level interpretations of its parameters. However, we should note that this interpretation is strictly valid only for gas-phase bimolecular reactions. For more complex reactions, particularly in solution, the physical meaning of the Arrhenius parameters becomes less clear, and we need more sophisticated theories to understand their molecular basis. 5.5 Limitations of Collision Theory as a Predictive Framework Collision theory works reasonably well for simple molecules but typically overestimates reaction rates for complex molecules. Two key limitations prevent collision theory from serving as a fully predictive framework: The activation energy E\\(\\mathrm{a}\\) appears as an arbitrary “threshold energy” that molecules must possess to react. While we can measure this energy experimentally, the theory provides no insight into how \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) varies between different reactions. While we can determine the steric factor \\(P\\) by comparing experimental and theoretical rate constants, we have no quantitative theory to predict its value. This means we cannot predict absolute rate constants for new reactions without experimental data.

While this works for some gas-phase reactions, it cannot predict steric factors or explain systematic trends in activation energies. We need a more sophisticated approach. For a reaction A + B → P, molecules must climb an energy barrier before forming products. The reaction coordinate diagram shows this energy profile, from reactants through to products. The point at the highest point of the energy barrier is called the transition state; at this point the reacting molecules form a specific arrangement called the activated complex, in which bonds are partially broken and new bonds are starting to form. Transition state theory provides a framework for analyzing this activated complex and using it to predict reaction rates. Figure 6.1: A reaction coordinate diagram for the reaction A + B → P. The energy profile shows the barrier that must be crossed as reactants are converted to products. The peak of this barrier corresponds to the transition state configuration, and the collection of molecules at the transition state form the activated complex, C\\(^\\ddagger\\). 6.2 Basic Principles of Transition State Theory Transition state theory treats the overall reaction A + B → P as occurring in two steps. First, the reactants A and B combine to form the activated complex C\\(^{\\ddagger}\\). This complex can either fall apart back to reactants or go on to form products. The theory makes a key assumption: we can treat the activated complex as being in equilibrium with the reactants, even though C\\(^{\\ddagger}\\) is inherently unstable. We call this a pseudo-equilibrium to reflect this special status. The second step is the conversion of C\\(^{\\ddagger}\\) to products, which we assume occurs with a characteristic rate constant \\(k^{\\ddagger}\\). This is a first-order process — the rate depends only on the concentration of the activated complex: \\[\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k^{\\ddagger}[\\mathrm{C}^{\\ddagger}]\\] We can write the complete process as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{C}^{\\ddagger} \\xrightarrow{k^{\\ddagger}} \\mathrm{P} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] 6.3 Mathematical Development of Transition State Theory To develop our rate equation, we begin by considering the pseudo-equilibrium between reactants and the activated complex. We can define a pseudo-equilibrium constant: \\[\\begin{equation} K^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{C}^{\\ddagger}]}{[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]} \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] This allows us to express the concentration of the activated complex in terms of reactant concentrations: \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{C}^{\\ddagger}] = K^{\\ddagger}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] Since we treat the formation of the activated complex as a pseudo-equilibrium, we can apply standard thermodynamic relationships. The equilibrium constant \\(K^{\\ddagger}\\) relates to the activation Gibbs energy through: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta G^{\\ddagger} = -RT\\ln(K^{\\ddagger}c^{\\circ}) \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] The reference concentration \\(c^{\\circ}\\) (1 mol dm\\(^{-3}\\)) ensures our rate constant will have the correct units.1 Breaking \\(\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}\\) into its enthalpic and entropic components: \\[\\begin{equation} K^{\\ddagger} = \\frac{1}{c^{\\circ}}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/RT} = \\frac{1}{c^{\\circ}}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}/RT}\\mathrm{e}^{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R} \\tag{6.5} \\end{equation}\\] From our second assumption, the rate of product formation is proportional to the concentration of the activated complex: \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k^{\\ddagger}[\\mathrm{C}^{\\ddagger}] = \\frac{k^{\\ddagger}}{c^{\\circ}}[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\mathrm{e}^{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}/RT} \\tag{6.6} \\end{equation}\\] This has the form of a second-order rate law with rate constant: \\[\\begin{equation} k = \\frac{k^{\\ddagger}}{c^{\\circ}}\\mathrm{e}^{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}/RT} \\tag{6.7} \\end{equation}\\] 6.4 Relationship to the Arrhenius Equation We can understand how transition state theory connects to experimental observations by comparing the rate constant expression with the Arrhenius equation: From transition state theory: \\[\\begin{equation} k = \\frac{k^{\\ddagger}}{c^{\\circ}}\\mathrm{e}^{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}/RT} \\tag{6.8} \\end{equation}\\] The Arrhenius equation: \\[\\begin{equation} k = A\\mathrm{e}^{-E_\\mathrm{a}/RT} \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] This comparison reveals two important correspondences: The activation enthalpy \\(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}\\) plays a similar role to the Arrhenius activation energy \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\). The pre-exponential factor \\(A\\) corresponds to \\(\\frac{k^{\\ddagger}}{c^{\\circ}}\\mathrm{e}^{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}/R}\\). Like collision theory, transition state theory provides a molecular-level interpretation of the Arrhenius parameters. However, transition state theory offers additional insight by separating the activation barrier into enthalpic (\\(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}\\)) and entropic (\\(\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}\\)) contributions, helping explain systematic variations in reactivity across related compounds. 6.5 Enthalpy of Activation The enthalpy of activation \\(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}\\) represents the enthalpic contribution to forming the activated complex. For a simple reaction where C breaks an A–B bond to form B–C, examining what happens at the transition state reveals why this enthalpy change varies systematically between related reactions. In the activated complex, the original A–B bond is almost completely broken, while the new B–C bond has only started to form. This means \\(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}\\) depends primarily on the strength of the bond being broken. The strength of the bond being formed has much less effect, since this bond is still weak in the transition state. This principle helps explain trends in activation energies for a family of related reactions. Consider these examples involving H and Br: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{H–H} + \\mathrm{H} &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{H–H} &amp; E_\\mathrm{a} &amp;= +39~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\\\ \\mathrm{H–H} + \\mathrm{Br} &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H} + \\mathrm{H–Br} &amp; E_\\mathrm{a} &amp;= +82~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br–H} + \\mathrm{H} &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{H–H} &amp; E_\\mathrm{a} &amp;= +12~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br–Br} + \\mathrm{H} &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br} + \\mathrm{Br–H} &amp; E_\\mathrm{a} &amp;= +4~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\end{align*}\\] To understand these trends, we need to consider the bond dissociation energies: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{H–H}: &amp; ~E_\\mathrm{d} = +436~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\\\ \\mathrm{H–Br}: &amp; ~E_\\mathrm{d} = +366~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br–Br}: &amp; ~E_\\mathrm{d} = +193~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}} \\end{align*}\\] The trends in activation energy can be explained by: The first two reactions involve breaking H–H bonds (highest \\(E_\\mathrm{d}\\)) → highest \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) values Between these two: H–H + H forms H–H (more favorable) H–H + Br forms H–Br (less favorable) Therefore \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) is lower for H–H + H The remaining reactions follow the trend in bond strength being broken: Breaking H–Br (\\(E_\\mathrm{a} = +12~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}\\)) Breaking Br–Br (\\(E_\\mathrm{a} = +4~\\mathrm{kJ~mol^{-1}}\\)) 6.6 Reconciling Transition State Theory with Collision Theory At first glance, Collision theory and transition state theory can seem to give different pictures of activation energy. In collision theory, \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\) represents a minimum kinetic energy molecules must have to react. In transition state theory, \\(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}\\) represents the energy needed to distort and partially break bonds bonds in the activated complex. We can connect these views by following the energy through a reactive collision. Initially, the molecules approach with kinetic energy at least equal to \\(E_\\mathrm{a}\\). As they collide, this kinetic energy transforms into potential energy, with the molecular geometry distorting to form the activated complex. Here, the initial kinetic energy has become the energy stored in partially broken and formed bonds — our \\(\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}\\). By energy conservation, these energies must be approximately equal. The two theories thus describe the same process from different perspectives: collision theory focuses on the keinetic energy molecules must have before they collide, while transition state theory considers how this energy is used in making and breaking bonds. 6.7 Entropy of Activation We have seen that transition state theory provides a molecular interpretation of the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor \\(A\\) in terms of an entropy of activation \\(\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}\\). To understand what this entropy term means and what determines its magnitude, we need to think carefully about what entropy means at a molecular level. 6.7.1 Understanding Molecular Entropy While entropy is often simply described as a measure of “disorder”, this description can be misleading. For many chemical reactions, simple arguments based on relative “disorder” fail to predict even qualitative behaviour. This becomes particularly apparent when considering gas-phase reactions: both reactants and products exist as freely moving molecules, so which state is more “disordered”? A more useful framework considers entropy in terms of molecular freedom and statistical likelihood. Systems with greater freedom have higher entropy than more constrained systems, and molecular arrangements that are statistically more likely have higher entropy than less likely arrangements. The spontaneous expansion of an ideal gas illustrates these ideas. An ideal gas expands to fill its container despite no change in internal energy (\\(\\Delta U = 0\\)) or enthalpy (\\(\\Delta H = 0\\), since \\(pV = nRT\\)). This process occurs spontaneously because the expanded state has higher entropy: gas molecules have more freedom to move through a larger volume, and an even distribution throughout the available space is statistically more likely than having all molecules confined to a smaller region. 6.7.2 Entropy of Activation for Bimolecular Reactions For a gas-phase bimolecular reaction, forming the activated complex introduces new constraints on molecular motion: \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{C}^{\\ddagger}\\] Each molecule in the gas phase has three translational degrees of freedom—the molecules are free to move along the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) axes, independently of the motion of the other molecules in the system. The reactants A and B therefore have six translational degrees of freedom between them. When these molecules combine to form the activated complex, however, we have just three translational degrees of freedom, since \\(\\mathrm{C}^{\\ddagger}\\) moves as a single unit through space. This loss of translational freedom corresponds to a decrease in entropy. For gas-phase bimolecular reactions, \\(\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}\\) is therefore always negative, reflecting the increased constraints imposed when forming the activated complex. Many basic treatments of transition state theory omit \\(c^{\\circ}\\) since it equals 1 under standard conditions. Including it ensures that \\(k\\) has the correct units for a second-order rate constant of dm\\(^3\\) mol\\(^{-1}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\).↩︎ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
