Chemical kinetics addresses the fundamental question of how chemical reactions proceed through time. While thermodynamics tells us about the driving forces and ultimate endpoints of reactions, kinetics reveals the pathways and speeds by which these endpoints are reached. Understanding chemical kinetics helps us to answer practical questions. For a given reaction, A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B, we might want to predict how much product B will be present after a given time, or how long it will take to achieve a desired conversion percentage from A to B. Figure 1.1: A plot of concentrations of reactant A and product B for a generic reaction A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B as a function of time. Over time, A is converted to B. How long will it take to obtain 90% yield? Going beyond this, can we optimise our reaction by changing the conditions (e.g., pressure or temperature)? How would these changes affect the overall rate of our reaction or the reaction yield? Figure 1.2: If we increase the temperature we (usually) expect our reaction to speed up. But by how much? If we increase the reaction temperature by 10 K, how much faster can we reach 90% yield? 1.2 Reaction Rates A core concept in chemical kinetics is the idea of a reaction rate — the speed at which chemical change happens. We express reaction rates mathematically as derivatives of the form \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\), representing the change in concentration of a species X with time. This rate can be positive (for products being formed) or negative (for reactants being consumed). For any reaction that does not have a 1:1 stoichiometry ratio between all reactants and products, the numerical “rate” will depend on the the chemical species we choose to define this. For example, for the reaction \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{B} \\end{equation}\\] the product, B, is formed at twice the rate that the reactant, A, is consumed. Hence, \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] In general, we can define an “overall” reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) that is related to the rates of change of reactants and products by \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n_\\mathrm{X}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n_\\mathrm{X}\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species \\(X\\) in the reaction equation. 1.3 Simple Rate Equations For many reactions, the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants, raised to some power; i.e., \\[\\nu = k [\\mathrm{A}]^a [\\mathrm{B}]^b [\\mathrm{C}]^c \\ldots\\] The proportionality constant, \\(k\\), is called the rate constant. The exponents, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) …, describe the order of the reaction with respect to the reactants A, B, C …. So, for a reaction \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C}\\] with rate equation (or “rate law”) \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2[\\mathrm{B}]\\], we would describe this as being second-order with respect to A, and first-order with respect to B. For rate equations that have the simple form above, we can define an overall order, which is the sum of the individual orders with respect to each of the reactants. In the example above, this reaction would be described as being third-order overall, since \\(a+b = 3\\). Not all reactions follow simple rate laws. For example, the reaction between H2 and Br2 to form HBr has an empirically-determined rate law \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^\\frac{1}{2}}{1+k^\\prime [\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br}_2]} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] This rate law is first-order with respect to H2, because \\(\\nu \\propto [\\mathrm{H_2}]\\). But we cannot define an order with respect to Br2, because the overall rate is not simply proportional to \\([\\mathrm{Br}_2]\\) raised to some power. Instead, we would describe the order with respect to Br2 as being undefined. This means the overall order is also undefined, since we cannot simply add the orders with respect to H2 and Br2. 1.4 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of one of more single-step “elementary” processes. For example, for the reaction \\(\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr}\\), where the empirical rate law is given by (1.1), one sequence of elementary processes that is consistent with this rate law is \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\\\ \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{H}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\tag{1.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] 1.4.1 Molecularity Elementary processes can be classified according to their molecularity — the number of reactant molecules that must come together for a particular reaction step. For example, in reaction mechanism (1.2), the first step involves the dissociation of Br2 to form two Br radicals: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\end{equation}\\] This reaction step involves a single reactant molecule, so it is described a unimolecular. The second step involves a Br radical and H2 molecule reacting: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\end{equation}\\] Because two reactant molecules must come together for this step, this is described as a bimolecular process. A process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species, as in the last step of the reaction mechanism above, is also bimolecular: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\end{equation}\\] 1.4.2 Rate Laws for Elementary Processes The rate laws for elementary processes directly reflect their molecularity. Unimolecular processes (\\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)) show first-order kinetics with rate \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\). Similarly, bimolecular processes show second-order kinetics: for a bimolecular process involving two distinct chemical species (\\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)), the process is first-order with respect to each species: \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\), while a bimolecular process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species (\\(2\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)) is second-order with respect to that species: \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\). Termolecular processes, involving three reactant molecules, show third order kinetics, e.g., \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2[\\mathrm{B}]\\). In general, termolecular processes are rare, because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with the correct orientation is very small. While termolecular processes can play a role at very high pressure, under more typical reaction conditions, experimental observations of third-order kinetics are often better explained by a complex multistep reaction mechanism. 1.5 Moving Between Concentration and Rate Perspectives The progression of any chemical reaction can be viewed from two complementary perspectives: the concentration of species as they change over time, \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\), and the instantaneous rates at which these changes occur, \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]/\\mathrm{d}t\\). These two perspectives both describe the same underlying chemical process, just viewed through different mathematical lenses. Consider a reactant A being consumed during a reaction. We might track its concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) as it decreases over time, giving us a curve of concentration versus time. At any point on this curve, we can determine the instantaneous rate of reaction by finding the slope of the tangent line. Mathematically, this is equivalent to computing the derivative of \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\), i.e., \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\). Since we are dealing with the concentration of a reactant, the reaction rate is then the negative of this derivative (since the concentrations of A decreases with time): \\(\\nu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\).
