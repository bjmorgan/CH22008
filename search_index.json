Chemical kinetics addresses the fundamental question of how chemical reactions proceed through time. While thermodynamics tells us about the driving forces and ultimate endpoints of reactions, kinetics reveals the pathways and speeds by which these endpoints are reached. Understanding chemical kinetics helps us to answer practical questions. For a given reaction, A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B, we might want to predict how much product B will be present after a given time, or how long it will take to achieve a desired conversion percentage from A to B. Figure 1.1: A plot of concentrations of reactant A and product B for a generic reaction A \\(\\longrightarrow\\) B as a function of time. Over time, A is converted to B. How long will it take to obtain 90% yield? Going beyond this, can we optimise our reaction by changing the conditions (e.g., pressure or temperature)? How would these changes affect the overall rate of our reaction or the reaction yield? Figure 1.2: If we increase the temperature we (usually) expect our reaction to speed up. But by how much? If we increase the reaction temperature by 10 K, how much faster can we reach 90% yield? 1.2 Reaction Rates A core concept in chemical kinetics is the idea of a reaction rate — the speed at which chemical change happens. We express reaction rates mathematically as derivatives of the form \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\), representing the change in concentration of a species X with time. This rate can be positive (for products being formed) or negative (for reactants being consumed). For any reaction that does not have a 1:1 stoichiometry ratio between all reactants and products, the numerical “rate” will depend on the chemical species we choose to define this. For example, for the reaction \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{B} \\end{equation}\\] the product, B, is formed at twice the rate that the reactant, A, is consumed. Hence, \\[2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] In general, we can define an “overall” reaction rate \\(\\nu\\) that is related to the rates of change of reactants and products by \\[\\nu = \\frac{1}{n_\\mathrm{X}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\] where \\(n_\\mathrm{X}\\) is the stoichiometric coefficient of species \\(X\\) in the reaction equation. 1.3 Simple Rate Equations For many reactions, the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the reactants, raised to some power; i.e., \\[\\nu = k [\\mathrm{A}]^a [\\mathrm{B}]^b [\\mathrm{C}]^c \\ldots\\] The proportionality constant, \\(k\\), is called the rate constant. The exponents, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) …, describe the order of the reaction with respect to the reactants A, B, C …. So, for a reaction \\[\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{C}\\] with rate equation (or “rate law”) \\[\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2[\\mathrm{B}]\\], we would describe this as being second-order with respect to A, and first-order with respect to B. For rate equations that have the simple form above, we can define an overall order, which is the sum of the individual orders with respect to each of the reactants. In the example above, this reaction would be described as being third-order overall, since \\(a+b = 3\\). Not all reactions follow simple rate laws. For example, the reaction between H2 and Br2 to form HBr has an empirically-determined rate law \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = k\\frac{[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^\\frac{1}{2}}{1+k^\\prime [\\mathrm{HBr}]/[\\mathrm{Br}_2]} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] This rate law is first-order with respect to H2, because \\(\\nu \\propto [\\mathrm{H_2}]\\). But we cannot define an order with respect to Br2, because the overall rate is not simply proportional to \\([\\mathrm{Br}_2]\\) raised to some power. Instead, we would describe the order with respect to Br2 as being undefined. This means the overall order is also undefined, since we cannot simply add the orders with respect to H2 and Br2. 1.4 Elementary Processes Any chemical reaction can be broken down into a sequence of one of more single-step “elementary” processes. For example, for the reaction \\(\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow 2\\mathrm{HBr}\\), where the empirical rate law is given by (1.1), one sequence of elementary processes that is consistent with this rate law is \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\\\ \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{H}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}_2 &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\\\ \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet &amp; \\longrightarrow &amp; \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\tag{1.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] 1.4.1 Molecularity Elementary processes can be classified according to their molecularity — the number of reactant molecules that must come together for a particular reaction step. For example, in reaction mechanism (1.2), the first step involves the dissociation of Br2 to form two Br radicals: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\end{equation}\\] This reaction step involves a single reactant molecule, so it is described a unimolecular. The second step involves a Br radical and H2 molecule reacting: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{H}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{HBr} \\end{equation}\\] Because two reactant molecules must come together for this step, this is described as a bimolecular process. A process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species, as in the last step of the reaction mechanism above, is also bimolecular: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet + \\mathrm{Br}^\\bullet \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\end{equation}\\] 1.4.2 Rate Laws for Elementary Processes The rate laws for elementary processes directly reflect their molecularity. Unimolecular processes (\\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)) show first-order kinetics with rate \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]\\). Similarly, bimolecular processes show second-order kinetics: for a bimolecular process involving two distinct chemical species (\\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)), the process is first-order with respect to each species: \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}]\\), while a bimolecular process that involves two molecules of the same chemical species (\\(2\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P}\\)) is second-order with respect to that species: \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2\\). Termolecular processes, involving three reactant molecules, show third order kinetics, e.g., \\(\\nu = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2[\\mathrm{B}]\\). In general, termolecular processes are rare, because the probability of three molecules colliding simultaneously with the correct orientation is very small. While termolecular processes can play a role at very high pressure, under more typical reaction conditions, experimental observations of third-order kinetics are often better explained by a complex multistep reaction mechanism. 1.5 Moving Between Concentration and Rate Perspectives The progression of any chemical reaction can be viewed from two complementary perspectives: the concentration of species as they change over time, \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\), and the instantaneous rates at which these changes occur, \\(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]/\\mathrm{d}t\\). These two perspectives both describe the same underlying chemical process, just viewed through different mathematical lenses. Consider a reactant A being consumed during a reaction. We might track its concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) as it decreases over time, giving us a curve of concentration versus time. At any point on this curve, we can determine the instantaneous rate of reaction by finding the slope of the tangent line. Mathematically, this is equivalent to computing the derivative of \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\), i.e., \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\). Since we are dealing with the concentration of a reactant, the reaction rate is then the negative of this derivative (since the concentrations of A decreases with time): \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] We can also go the other way from a description of rate to a description of the concentration profile over time. Mathematically we do this by integration, which is the inverse operation to differentiation. By integrating a rate, we effectively sum all the small changes in concentration over some time interval. For example, the change in concentration of A from the start of a reaction at \\(t=0\\) is given by \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t - [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = \\int_0^t -\\nu(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] Whether we work in terms of concentrations or rates depends on the question we are trying to answer, what information we have available to us, and whether it is more mathematically convenient to work with one than the other. Figure 1.3: If we know the concentration of a reactant or product as a function of time we can calculate the rate of change of this concentration by differentiation. We can also calculate how concentrations vary in time from rates by the inverse procedure, integration. 1.6 Integrating Simple Rate Laws For simple rate laws of the form \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^n\\] we can derive corresponding integrated rate laws by integrating (see CH12002 Lecture 3). 1.6.1 First-Order Reactions For a first-order process \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\), the rate of change of concentration of reactant, A, is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}] \\end{equation}\\] To derive the corresponding integrated rate law, we rearrange this to form an integral equation: \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{\\mathrm[A]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]}\\,\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\end{equation}\\] where the limits of the integral with respect to concentration of A are between the concentration at time \\(0\\) (\\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\)) and the concentration at time \\(t\\) (\\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\)), and the limits of the integral with respect to time are between \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=t\\). Integrating, using the integral \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\ln x\\), gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln [\\mathrm{A}]_t - \\ln [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = -kt \\end{equation}\\] which can be rearranged as \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\tag{1.5} \\end{equation}\\] Hence, for a first-order process, the concentration of the reactant decays exponentially with time. Having derived an expression for \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) we can now derive the integrated rate law for the concentration of the product, B, as a function of time. To do so, we use the known stoichoimetry of the reaction: for every molecule of A consumed, one molecule of B is formed, so the total concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}] + [\\mathrm{B}]\\) must be constant. Furthermore, when \\(t=0\\), only A is present, with a concentration \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). So, \\([\\mathrm{A}] + [\\mathrm{B}] = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). Substituting in our expression for \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) (Eqn. (1.5) gives \\[\\begin{eqnarray} [\\mathrm{B}] &amp; = &amp; [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\\\ &amp; = &amp; [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\left(1-\\mathrm{e}^{-kt}\\right) \\end{eqnarray}\\] Hence, for a first-order process, the concentration of the product exponentially approaches a limit of \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\). Figure 1.4: Concentrations as a function of time for a first-order process \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). 1.6.2 Second-Order Reactions For a second-order process \\(2\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\), with overall rate \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\), the rate of change of concentration of reactant, A, is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2k[\\mathrm{A}]^2 \\tag{1.6} \\end{equation}\\] As for first-order reactions, above, we can derive the corresponding integrated rate law for \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) by rearranging Eqn. (1.6) and then integrating: \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}^{\\mathrm[A]_t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}] = \\int_0^t -k\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\end{equation}\\] Integrating, using the integral \\(\\int \\frac{1}{x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{1}{x}\\), gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_t} - \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} = -kt \\end{equation}\\] which can be rearranged as \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{1 + kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0} \\end{equation}\\] To obtain an expression for \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t\\), we again use our knowledge of the reaction stoichiometry and initial conditions: we start with only the reactant A, and at any stage of the reaction, the amount of B formed is equal to half the amount of A consumed. \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{1}{2}\\left([\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}]_t\\right) \\end{equation}\\] And, so \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{1+kt[\\mathrm{A}_0]}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] which rearranges to \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_t = \\frac{kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0^2}{2(1 + kt[\\mathrm{A}]_0)} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 1.5: Concentrations as a function of time for a second-order process \\(2\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). The dashed line shows the sum \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t + [\\mathrm{B}]_t\\). Aside: Why Does Our Second-Order Rate Equation Include a Factor of 2? Let us briefly examine the origin of the factor of 2 on the right-hand side of Eqn. @ref{eq:secondorderdiff}. Writing the rate equation for \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) in this way is consistent with the convention in Section 1.2, that the overall rate of a reaction is related to the rates of change of specific reactants or products by \\[\\begin{equation} \\nu = \\frac{1}{n_\\mathrm{X}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{X}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\tag{1.7} \\end{equation}\\] We can also justify the factor of \\(2\\) by recognising that the stoichiometry of the reaction requires 2 molecules of A to be consumed for every 1 molecule of B formed, and, hence, \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\end{equation}\\] The factor of 2 in Eqn. (1.6) is somewhat arbitrary though, as it is a consequence of our choice to define the overall rate of reaction as \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\). If, instead, we define our overall rate as \\(\\nu = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) then we would write the rate of change of concentration of A as \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}]^2 \\tag{1.8} \\end{equation}\\] The functional form for \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\) is the same in both cases (Eqns. (1.6) and (1.8). Our choice of how we define our overall rate, however, determines what the rate constant \\(k\\) actually describes. The rate constant in (1.8) is equal to twice the rate constant in (1.6). Upon reflection, it should perhaps not be surprising that the numerical value of our rate constant \\(k\\) depends on how we choose to define the reaction rate. Whichever of these two ways we choose to define our overall rate, the procedure for deriving the second-order intergrated rate law is unchanged, and we end up with the same functional form for the integrated rate law — either with, or without, the factor of 2 carried through the derivation. 1.7 From Mechanisms to Rate Laws The relationship between reaction mechanisms and the time evolution of chemical concentrations depends strongly on the complexity of the reaction scheme. For reactions that consist of a single elementary process, we can usually determine how the concentrations of reactants and products evolve with time through a straightforward two-step process: Write down the rate equations for reactants and products based on the molecularity of the elementary process Directly integrate these rate equations to obtain the corresponding integrated rate laws For example, we have already seen how this works for first-order processes in Section 1.6. For reactions with multistep mechanisms, however, the path from mechanism to time evolution is often more complex. Our starting point is always the reaction mechanism itself—the sequence of elementary processes that describes the complete reaction scheme. From this mechanism, we write differential rate equations for all chemical species that appear, including not only the reactants and products, but also any reaction intermediates. When analysing multistep mechanisms, we typically pursue one or both of two goals: To derive an expression for the overall reaction rate in terms of reactant concentrations only, eliminating any dependence on intermediate concentrations To obtain integrated rate laws that describe how the concentrations of reactants and products vary with time How we approach these goals depends on the nature of the reaction mechanism under consideration. In general, we can analyse complex reaction mechanisms using one of three strategies: 1.7.1 Exact Solutions For some reaction mechanisms, we can derive exact analytical solutions to our coupled differential rate equations. While this approach is the most mathematically satisfying, it is only possible for relatively simple reaction schemes. 1.7.2 Approximate Analytical Solutions More commonly, we can simplify our set of coupled differential equations by applying chemical approximations based on the physical nature of the reaction mechanism. We then solve these simplified equations to obtain analytical solutions that accurately describe the real system within the range of conditions where our approximations hold. This approach often provides valuable chemical insight into the factors controlling reaction rates and time evolution. 1.7.3 Numerical Integration When analytical solutions prove intractable, we can always fall back on numerical methods. By numerically integrating our differential rate equations, we can model how the concentrations of all species—reactants, products, and intermediates—evolve over time. While this approach will always work in principle, it may provide less direct insight into the underlying chemical processes than analytical solutions, even approximate ones. Although numerical integration provides a reliable method of last resort, there is often significant value in pursuing analytical solutions, either exact or approximate. These solutions can reveal fundamental relationships between reaction parameters and chemical behavior that might be obscured in purely numerical results.

Often, we start by collecting experimental concentration-time data for some reaction, and using this to deduce an empirical rate law (see CH12002 Lecture 4). Once we have an empirical rate law, this can inform our thinking around possible reaction mechanisms. The rate law may be of the same form as for another reaction where we know the mechanism, and so we propose that our current reaction proceeds by an equivalent mechanism. Or our empirical rate law simply acts as a constraint: any proposed mechanisms must give a theoretical rate law that is consistent with out experimentally deduced rate law. Alternatively, we might start from some hypothetical reaction mechanism: perhaps proposed on the basis of some prior chemical knowledge we have about our specific reaction. From this proposed mechanism, we can predict the shape of concentration-time profiles we would expect in experiments, given that our mechanism is correct, and then compare our predicted concentration-time profiles to those obtained from experiments. If we find good agreement between our predicted concetration-time data and those recorded experimentally then this provides support for our proposed mechanism being correct. If our predicted concentration-time data, however, do not agree with our experimental results — in particular, if the predicted and experimental concentration-time profiles have qualitatively different shapes — then we can reject the proposed mechanism on the basis that it is inconsistent with experiment. TODO: add comment that if we do find good agreement between our model and our data, we can then use the experimental data to estimate any parameters in our model (in this case, these are rate constants for elementary steps or combinations of these rate constants). 4.2 The Role of Integration in Chemical Kinetics For simple reaction mechanisms, we can often derive analytical expressions for how concentrations change with time. Consider a first-order reaction \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). The differential rate equation is \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}] \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] and we can solve this by integration to obtain \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_t = [\\mathrm{A}]_0\\mathrm{e}^{-kt} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] TODO: Add commentary that we can validate this against experimental data (usually done by plotting our data according to the linear form of this first-order intergrated rate equation – if our data when plotted in this form are approximately linear, then we have supporting evidence for our proposed mechanism. If our data are not linear when plotted in this form, then the data contradict our hypothesis of a first-order process. If our data do appear consistent with out proposed mechanism, we can then fit our model to the data to estimate the first-order rate constant \\(k\\). However, for many reaction mechanisms, deriving analytical solutions becomes either extremely difficult or impossible. Consider, for example, the Lindemann mechanism for a unimolecular reaction: \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{M} &amp;\\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}^* + \\mathrm{M} &amp; k_1,\\, k_{-1} \\\\ \\mathrm{A}^* &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{P} &amp; k_2 \\end{align*}\\] The corresponding differential rate equations are: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] + k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A}^*][\\mathrm{M}] \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}^*]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_1[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{M}] - k_{-1}[\\mathrm{A}^*][\\mathrm{M}] - k_2[\\mathrm{A}^*] \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{P}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_2[\\mathrm{A}^*] \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] While we can make approximations (such as the steady-state approximation) to derive approximate analytical solutions under certain conditions, numerical integration provides a general approach that can be applied to any mechanism, regardless of its complexity. 4.3 Principles of Numerical Integration To understand how numerical integration works, let us return to our simple first-order reaction \\(\\mathrm{A} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{B}\\). The differential rate equations are: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}] \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = +k[\\mathrm{A}] \\tag{4.7} \\end{equation}\\] The numerical integration approach recognises that these equations tell us the instantaneous rates of change of \\([\\mathrm{A}]\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]\\) at any point in time. If we know these rates at time \\(t\\), we can estimate the concentrations a short time later, at \\(t + \\Delta t\\): \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{A}]_{t+\\Delta t} = [\\mathrm{A}]_t + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Delta t \\tag{4.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} [\\mathrm{B}]_{t+\\Delta t} = [\\mathrm{B}]_t + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\Delta t \\tag{4.9} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta t\\) is called the time step. Starting with known initial concentrations at \\(t = 0\\), we can use these equations to “step forward” in time, calculating new concentrations at each step. 4.3.1 A Simple Example Let us work through a specific example. Consider the first-order reaction above with \\(k = 1\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) and initial conditions \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 = 1\\,\\mathrm{M}\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_0 = 0\\,\\mathrm{M}\\). Using a time step \\(\\Delta t = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}\\): At \\(t = 0~\\mathrm{s}\\): \\([\\mathrm{A}]_0 = 1~\\mathrm{M}\\) \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(1~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(1~\\mathrm{M}) = -1~\\mathrm{M}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_{0.1} = 1~\\mathrm{M} + (-1~\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.1\\mathrm{s}) = 0.9~\\mathrm{M}\\) Similarly, \\([\\mathrm{B}]_{0.1} = 0~\\mathrm{M} + (1~\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.1\\mathrm{s}) = 0.1~\\mathrm{M}\\) At \\(t = 0.1~\\mathrm{s}\\): \\([\\mathrm{A}]_{0.1} = 0.9~\\mathrm{M}\\) \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -(1~\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.9~\\mathrm{M}) = -0.9~\\mathrm{M}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\) \\([\\mathrm{A}]_{0.2} = 0.9~\\mathrm{M} + (-0.9~\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.1\\mathrm{s}) = 0.81~\\mathrm{M}\\) This process continues, giving us approximate values for \\([\\mathrm{A}]_t\\) and \\([\\mathrm{B}]_t\\) at discrete time points. 4.4 Sources of Error The numerical integration method makes one key approximation: it assumes the reaction rates remain constant over each time step. In reality, rates change continuously as concentrations change. This approximation introduces systematic errors that become larger when: The time step \\(\\Delta t\\) is increased Reaction rates change more rapidly within each time step We can improve accuracy by: Using a smaller time step (at the cost of more computational steps) Using more sophisticated algorithms (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods) that better approximate the changing reaction rates 4.5 Practical Implementation The basic method described above is easily implemented in Python: def dA_by_dt(k1, A): return -k1 * A def dB_by_dt(k1, A): return +k1 * A # Initial conditions and parameters A0, B0 = 1.0, 0.0 # Initial concentrations (M) k1 = 1.0 # Rate constant (s⁻¹) dt = 0.1 # Time step (s) # Arrays to store results A_stored = [A0] B_stored = [B0] timesteps = [0] # Main integration loop t = 0 A = A0 B = B0 simulation_time = 5.0 while t &lt; simulation_time: dA = dA_by_dt(k1, A) * dt dB = dB_by_dt(k1, A) * dt A += dA B += dB A_stored.append(A) B_stored.append(B) t += dt "],["lecture5.html", "Lecture 5 Simple Collision Theory", " Lecture 5 Simple Collision Theory TODO "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
